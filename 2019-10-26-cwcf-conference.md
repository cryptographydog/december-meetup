## Event Summary

- made note of lack of diversity at event
    - acknowledged that i was humbled by my welcome, and was very nervous to mention something might on the surface seem like criticism, but was actually opportunity.
    - clarified that spoken from a place of care
    - recognition that equity is _hard_ and we try and fail all the time in the spaces I'm in. but important to be voicing the ways we're struggling.
    - 1/4 Canada is "visible minority"
    - capital economy is already not treating those well who aren't already in power. would hope that in the co-op economy, we might respond to that, and perhaps even "oversteer" in our goals of representation.
    - mentioned that it was noted last year but a woman of colour in attendance. She's not back this year
    - there's nothing explicitly in CWCF strategic plan about diversity & inclusion of movement
    - there is no committee working on it
- reba is wonderful!
    - Sam is also with urbane cycle. marketing & comms.
    - recommended we drop in sometime.
    - potential opportunity to work together
- hazel seemed very interested in hacknight community model
- spoke with Sonja (St Mary's University academic) about coopdevs model, re: community+co-op.
    - spoke with research assistance Cian (key-an), who has a labour background. really interested in that intersection
- chris @ parIT: http://www.parit.ca/about-parit/
- someone (older man) recommended i run for board, just based on the way i was contributing on final day

### session 2

- Rick.
- Sun Certified building co-op
- high perf builds and retrofits.
- in some towns, the co-ops are the only businesses left standing
- BUILD: Urban Industry for Local Development
	- 80% indigenous employees. manitoba.
	- Purpose Construction. another business was taking ppl trained in BUILD and give them stable work (also focussed on new immigrants)
- want to be involved in larger buildings. more capacity for high-perf in large buildings. also care about density.
- high value alignement. same worldview. bring ppl up.
- WHY does gov building shitty buildings for low-income persons, who then can’t pay heat, when you can build so that there’s no heat bill
- Purpose Construction has an angel funder who wants them to design 30 housing units.
	- funder: if it works well, we’ll do more. standalone. co-op housing.
- want to break into reserve housing. e.g., mid-northern reserve.
	- “reserve housing.” shittiest home you can build. “building down to code.”
	- reserve just finihsed land claim. taking over barracks. long plains reserve. unoccupied fed land. we get first choice.
	- #ask is purpose training employees as owners? with co-op, each can start their own company.
- we love to build, but we don’t have to build. purpose construction can.
- plan = to start factory to do wall builds and ship them out. purpose is in industrial section, with lots of vacant buildings
	- factory for walls is a lower skill environment. good for training. so purpose training being near factory would be huge.
	- #ask where might the divides be with the incentives of purpose. how might they want to expand that might be in conflict with co-op goals?
- habitat with humanity discussions. high level of material theft. hard to manage on-site. volunteer “stick build” (building on site).
-
