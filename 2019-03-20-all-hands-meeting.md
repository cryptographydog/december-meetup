### Naming Next Steps

- [Pre-NUANs search](https://hackmd.io/PU9T21lLT0a88haz94lnSw?view)
    - free version search. official will cost money.
    - "hypha" = taken in Toronto
    - a bit unclear of whether/how we can move forward if conflict
        - #todo ~~ask someone~~
    - conflicts explained, but unclear
    - ben: distinctive component could be "worker cooperative"
    - distinctiveness component != legal mark, eg. "inc"
    - unsure if "cooperative" is part of mark #todo
- NUANS report _officiale_
    - $50 per search
    - if looks good, 90 days to submit the Articles of Incorporation
- Incorporation process ~$400 total (incrementally in steps)
    - #todo buy domain if we initiate ($120/year .coop, requires incorp)
    - ben: talk about larger costs now? dcwalk: suggests working out over 3mo.
        - udit: suggests we just think of it as loan to future company. all: agree.
    - dcwalk: temp check. $1050 float split $150 by 7 ppl, with some affordance for financial capacities. 7/7 ok.
        - #todo let's track. all agreed. spreadsheet. ~~notepad?~~ spreadsheet, wave accounting
        - yurko/ben: might be worth using accounting for bank integration.
        - #todo start investigating accounting software
