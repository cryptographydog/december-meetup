## Announcements

    - if anyone wants access, just ask. (have been talking about it with others in tech co-op network)
- yurko: nonprofit status and github task?


## Notes

### GitHub issue grooming session

- Start on doing, discussed more in depth, updated checklists, and moved from stack
    - Odoo, one sentance on what problem it will solve? 
- Moved to todo, added in prioritizing / block labelling 
- Did a quick review of backlog, some belong there, others don't 
    - Some discussion of whether or what label fits, "blocked"? "not yet due"?
- Took approx. 25 mins

- Reflection
    - Chair / one person grooms backlog rather than us all collectively?

- Task board review
    - [Priority: ★★★](https://github.com/orgs/hyphacoop/projects/2?card_filter_query=label%3Awg%3Ainfra-ops+label%3A%5Bpriority-★★★%5D)

### Values and Tool Choices 

0. Why are we having this convo? What is the "problematic" we've identified?

- patcon:
    - b/c used to working in non-tech communities
    - feel choices might lack compassion for those with "other missions" than open source / ideal tools
    - especially in scarcely-resourced communities.
    - want to know we're factoring in the mission of the people we're serving. want to feel responsible in referring people/orgs i know to us. want to know that we will try to understand the tools we don't want to win, as well as the tools we do.
- yurko:
    - picking tools is difficult, wanting to walk a fine line of open source / closed source
        - trust, mission-critical uses, "results" when they matter
        - also issues of how, where, (mis)uses of closed source ecosystem
- elon:
    - Harder to decide between closed source and open-source
    - Key idea: control over data, versus better experience (closed-source)
- dc: 
    - more than just closed source vs. open 
    - would be nice to have a strong set of values that tell us where we choose what
    - ...
    - [name=patcon] sorry, bad connx


1. identify where we have articulated our values 
    - Formally (long-list)
        - values list (retreat dec 2018)
        - mission and vision (retreat dec 2018)
        - meeting notes? (sparsely)
    - Informally
        - affiliations (communities) e.h., tomesh, civic tech, edgi, ournetworks
        - chat (not reaching conclusion)
        - loomio (in context of discussions)
        - practices (tools?) <-- struggling with!
        - cotech forum threads (patcon)
        - conversations with allies and potential clients (patcon)

2. what values do we think we have that might not be acknowledged? 
    - What values do you think you have that others don't?
    - What values do others hold that you think the others don't?

        - priority for open source 
        - "service first" mentality (@patcon) -- recognizable from the mouth of the person we aspire to serve
        - anti-oppression/justice perspective (dcwalk)
        - pragmatic (dcwalk +1 patcon) 
    
3. how do we work (in a timely fashion) in a way that is aligned with our values

#todo dc: move this values to loomio
#todo dc: pick up this values convo next infra call

-- 

  - Talk about them!
    - Ask each other questions
    - Stand ups 
    - All the time!
  - Write them down!
    - Vision and Mission Statements
    - Priority Matrix-- what opportunities we're pursuing
      - Time-sensitive
    - Set of guides of rules of thumb
      - e.g. Deep adaptation: 
        - Resilience asks us  "how do we keep wha we really want to keep?"
        - Relinquishment asks us "what do we need to let go of in order to not make matters words?"
        - Restoration asks us "wat can we bring back to help us with the coming dificulties and tragedies?"
  - Reflect on them
    - Post-mortems
