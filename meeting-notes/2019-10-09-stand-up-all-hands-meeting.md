## Discussions


- Resolutions and officer appointment wrap-up
    - Issue: [`organizing#113`: Signed resolution for appointing officers](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/pull/113)
    - [3 Options (file view)](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/tree/res/001-appoint-officers/resolutions/resolution-001)

- original proposal, probably not really legally valid, because 
- from template for resolution
- option A: using name "obfuscated" with different font, keep public or private
- option B: using name clear, keep public or private
- option C: have someone else as president

- thoughts?
    - pc: keep closed for now and sign A because more likely we'll open it later
    - yj: good A-C
    - bl: slightly against A bc obfuscation is long-term risk but not blocking, block on C, prefer B keep private for now or public if everyone is fine with it
        - concern with obfuscation = future searchability or leak into other places

- **CONSENSED** on: (among all present)
    - option A (obfuscated)
    - open repo for now
