# 2019-09-09 Hypha: Public Lab, overview of weekly meeting protocols

:date: **Date:** Mon, Sept 9  
:family: **Who's here?** patcon, lizbarry

Patcon had informal walk-through with Liz Barry, Directory of Community Development at Public Lab, about the protocols for weekly meetings in their distributed organization (10-year-old non-profit).

## Notes

- Org uses two Google calendars
    1. one for daily availability
        - each person fills expected work-day down to 15 minute precision
        - doesn't change after, and shouldn't change often
        - changes to events in this calendar are logged in a spreadsheet
        - used to determine payroll
        - one person has role of auditing that regularly, so not changed after (affecting payroll) and last-minute changes not made (affecting coordination)
    2. one for any internal meetings/events and vacation/travel time
        - yes, both in same calendar
- daily check-ins
    - every morning, people do written checkin in #morning-hello channel
    - expected within 30 minutes of start scheduled work day
- two types of weekly meetings (Monday & Wednesday)
    - each have a facilitator and note-taker (cycled via scheduling spreadsheet)
        - all take turns doing these roles (no one gets a pass)
    - both start with fun personal checkin-in question created by facilitator
    1. project update meeting
        - starts with personal question
        - not intended to be conversational, just updates
            - in practice, senior staff sometimes ask for clarity and make things more conversational than intended, but new ppl don't appreciate this
        - lots of little projects in template (see below), and updates are offered
        - status check, to prevent people working alone or autonomously from going off the rails without sharing
        - projects are free to use any time tracker
    2. discussion meeting
        - people add discussion and questions to meeting agenda in advance (advance notice important mainly for big discussion items)
        - if controversial topic, people should be alerted in advance, to come prepared
        - bottom of doc included "commitments & decisions" section, filled out on the fly
            - reviewed before end of meeting, and assigned to ppl. revisited next meeting.
            - tends to be place for misc action items that fall outside project scope
            - gets emailed out each week for accountability
