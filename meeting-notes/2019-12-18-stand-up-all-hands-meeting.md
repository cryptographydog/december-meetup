## Year-end Discussion and Reflection

- Business Planning
    - Business planning had a hard time meeting
    - Biz. dev was more exciting beyond the (grind) of writing business plan
- Finances
    - Multi-currency challenging
    - Exciting to have the books up and running, good state for year-end
    - Exciting to have a resource to call on
    - Glad for pivot to Wagepoint and patcon's research on that
    - Little too easy to think things are locked-in and decision paralysis
    - No domain area expertise, more effective researh, better way to lean on expertise?
    - Finding out yurko knew tons of bookkeeping
- Governance
    - Struggled with meeting, an issue with no standing time
    - Split between operations and governance? e.g., effective meetings, etc...
- Infra/Ops
    - Straddles two areas which might diffuse 
    - Need to think about split of working group and tasks, what is relationship between governance, operations, and infra?
    - Stuggles with meeting regularly and with purpose
    - Long time getting to decision, want to reduce this in the new year
    - Able to move fast on infrastructure, but slower pace on everything else
    - A lot of moving into uncomfortable spaces

- pc: Missing an understanding what a success would be, knowing what that would be in the next quarter. Getting goals and checking back on them
    - Have: 2018 December retreat milestones
    - Have: (light) Strategic Plan in Business Plan (until AGM)
    - #todo uv: kick-off January call with goal-setting
