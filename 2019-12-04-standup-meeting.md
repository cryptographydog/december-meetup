## Discussions

1. Prioritize payroll
    - uv: physically getting money to ppl vs. recording transactions
    - dc: written authorization
    - bl: is there a need to look at written auth?
        - Not sure about blockers
    - yj: just do it
    - pc: QB streams standard and advanced
        - Advanced is more expensive if done more than once a month
        - Maybe not rush on choosing?
    - dc: not addressed; percentage cut
        - What's the take for the organization? Let's decide on this call
    - bl: 20-30% was discussed
        - No vacation
        - Clip:
            - pc: 15-30%
    - Move forward on 20% clip?
        - dc: Estimate for employeers 15-18%
        - Operating costs
        - Set below 18%?
        - Have a rationale for percentage
    - 15% is min (cover everything)
        - 18% with a little bit of padding
        - Health adds on top
    - pc: 25% clip
        - bl: good with it
        - yj: good
        - All concensed

- Parallel branding efforts
    - ben: gi, uv, pc sync up pls
