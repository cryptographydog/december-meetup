## Notes

:+1: Agreement
:heart: Feeling
:bulb: Ideas/Proposals

- business plan
    - dc: let's treat this as snapshotted doc that goes to sleep, not living doc :+1:
        - :bulb: let's put away and revisit for AGM? :+1: all
    - pc: On social assistance rn: Ontario Works. part of that is to write and review a business plan with Toronto Business Development Centre.
        - can use our biz plan? :+1: all
        - will keep comments for later incorp during next round
        - uv: #todo make snapshot before comments
    - bl: this is intenal doc, right? all: yes.
- #136 Intro deck: https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/136
    - uv: project ppl pls put a paragraph (Primal Glow, Aether) #todo:bl+pc
    - uv: what other capabilities to put in a client-facing deck
    - uv: schedule half hour to do some brainstorming. #todo:uv schedule in new year.
    - bl: overlap with website and garry's work
    - uv: timeline, done by end of Jan
    - all: focus on prior experiences and skillsets
    - dc: suggestion: template, ways to add future projects/elements to it
        - bl: maybe include sufficient details in internal project proposal template
            - uv: yes, though audience a little different
    - dc: go back to CWCF proposal and get those prior experiences in the deck since we alrdy have permission to share #action
- #119 CRM and client pipeline
    - what are our pipelines?
    - bl: :heart: current columns don't work for me
    - uv+bl: :bulb: let's make one default one that suits us
        - pc: :bulb: let's just ditch "one pipeline" approach and just label with percentages. project can define its own pipeline during project definition, and we'll converge on one pipeline later? :-1: uv,bl. will lose high-level view.
        - uv: we can change later, so let's do one default :+1:
    - uv: :bulb: internal buy-in is part of pipeline :+1:
        - before or after research? before.
    - pc: :bulb: don't care about column labels. but my only strong preference is to have a first inactive columns, and the next one for more active deals like ~~████████~~ :+1:
    - uv: :heart: backlog (first column) feels like "potential leads"
    - some "percentage closed" numbers stay the same in progressing columns.
        - pc: :bulb: let's have them always go up?
            - bl: :heart: don't want to give fake appearance of progress
            - uv: can always change, right? yes
            - bl: :bulb: adding +5 increments
    - uv: :heart: confusing because some of these are gates ("qualified to buy") and some are states ("in development") :+1: pc
        - clear endings vs fuzzy
    - what does "development [started]" lead to? what does it mean?
    - ben walked through example: aether.
    - #todo filter existing deals into columns (ben)
- what's our ongoing schedule for biz planning?
    - :bulb: commit to next week only
        - can figure out new year sched later
    - pc: suggested weekly
        - uv: can't do 2h if weekly. +1 pc bl
        - pc: :bulb: longer cowork, ending in 30m meeting
    - #todo:patcon add proposed bizdev schedule to calendar
