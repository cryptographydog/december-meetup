## Agenda

- Decide on Wagepoint :+1:
- TransferWise add balance
- Decide on pro-forma vs. invoice

## Notes

_`#acc` indicates questions for our accountant_

- Consensed on using Wagepoint
- Vacation earned
    - Based on pay, or hours
- QB does employee vacation on $ values
- From accounting perspective, the vacation days an employee takes comes out of a different account
- At what rate does it get paid out?
    - At pre-defined rate?
- Each employee keeps an individual vacation account
- pc: https://blog.wagepoint.com/canada/4-ways-to-handle-vacation-pay
- bl: get 4% added every paycheque, least admin burden
- yj: "we want to have vacation pay", so clearing out the vacation pay account every paycheque seems to walk back on that
- pc: okay with Option 1 for now, but agree with yj that it feels to not be what I want long-term
- pc, yj: want to do Option 1 until we inquire best option from our accountant #acc
    - bl: +1
- Each paycheque +4% of the amount on the paycheque earning
- yj: collect [TD1-ON](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/td1-personal-tax-credits-returns/td1-forms-pay-received-on-january-1-later/td1on.html) and [TD1](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/td1-personal-tax-credits-returns/td1-forms-pay-received-on-january-1-later/td1.html) soon
    - pc: will do
- bl: walked thru opening a balance in TransferWise
- yj: pro-forma, not legally binding, if payment not received we can send an invoice that is legally binding
    - yj: other option, receive money then change the invoice, seems shady
    - yj: when this becomes a problem we'll probably have multi-currency accounting
    - pc: okay with pro-forma not being legally binding
- bl, yj: clarified process to do pro-forma (as QB invoice) -> invoice
    - In pro-forma stage, we can still do NET30, but exchange rate is an estimate, and upon receiving the money, adjust to actual exchange rate and change title to invoice to send client
