## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- Pre-convo took us into meeting
- dc: holiday mostly catching up on slowing down

### Milestones Review

From [December 2018 retreat](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/blob/master/2018-december-retreat/2018-12-08-retreat-day-02.md#prioritizing-and-working-groups):
- ✅ Select mailing address (in convo with other WGs)
- ✅ Select “incorporators”
- ✅ Draft articles of incorporation
- ✅ Submit articles of incorporation 2019 Q1
- Draft early/initial core bylaws
- Consult a lawyer over by-laws (“Confirmation of legal standing”)
- Finalize bylaws
- [Plan for] the initial General Meeting 2020 Q1, by-laws adopted, director/board for upcoming year set)
- Notes:
    - dc: thinks "Finalize bylaws" means formally adopt

From [Strategic Plan in Business Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8C1XZcDpu1r4ciecbKEZ6vOL41nTinfqPCbZDhkAWc/edit#heading=h.wxrk0oblag6u):   
- Prepare for first AGM
    - Implement peer interviewing
    - Determine first training
    - Build to consensus on Bylaws
    - Operations implementation report
    - Y2 Financial Plan
    - Milestones
        - Pick date
        - Draft bylaws
        - First directors selected 
- Implement Engagement Strategy
    - Develop initial brand
    - Build relationships
    - Milestones
        - Develop brand lookbook
        - Re-launch website
        - Defined “Local Solidarity and Decentralized Neighbours”
- Notes:
    - dc: "First directors selected" an outcome, not milestone?
    - pc: "first training"? --> aspirational from using our development fund!
    - pc: "operations implementation report"? dc: think this was a status update
    - dc: is engagement strategy mostly business development?

From 2019-12-18 all hands:

    - ✅ Determined head office

- ✅ Ensured compliance with WSIB expectations
- ✅ Set up time for 2020 Q1 regular meetings and co-work session to work on:
    - Draft initial bylaws
    - Plan for initial General Meeting 2020 Q1

### Task Board Review

- [Governance][gov-wg] :white_check_mark: [`wg:governance`][l-gov]
    - Archive _Done_ tasks :tada:
    - Review [HIGH `[priority-★★★]`][l-pri-hi]
    - Triage new tasks
    - missing labels [`wg:NULL`][l-none] | [`[priority-NULL]`][l-pri-none]

- Did a triage in order except looked at missing labels 


### Discussions

- Governance and Operations boundary?
    - dc: concern over just bolting Ops on, should be its own thing (even if meets together/has same people for now.)
        - very different scale of action
        - worried if/how operations gets "ghettoized" as the no one wants to do tasks if left by itelf
    - pc: importance of defining roles
- What makes a successful AGM? What is it not?
    - pc: Should feel celebratory. Assuming bare minimum requirements are already done. Shouldn't feel rote/procedural (despite things being stacked in favour of that happening)
    - dc: Alleviates tensions from previous year and sets a course for upcoming, in motivating way. Not a place to initiate controversial convos. If challenging topics, should have prep. No surprises.
- Proposal for Operations:
    - New tag for "in between" tasks (`needs-review`, `ownership-issue`, `boundary-object`)
    - `wg:ops` as new tag, rename existing to `wg:infra` 
    - "Ops" work (potentially) addressed at Governance WG for now.
- Things to take to meeting today:
    - Question: 
        - Are there roles that you think we need to be successful? Which ones do you think are most important?
        - What makes a successful AGM? What is it not?
    - Proposal for Operations

### Parked discussions

- #140 Improve org-wide task flow
- What do we want to get out of these meetings?
- #102 Roadmapping to the AGM
- Scope of Working Group
- Peer-reviewing
 
### Process Checkout

- Did not happen today
