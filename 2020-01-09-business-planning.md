## Notes

### Brainstorming BizDev Working Group Objectives

- bl:
    - have a plan that will get us to revenue goals, could incl. sub-goals 
    - focus on projects we have a chance of winning
        - more time talking abt past projects and our thoughts on chances of success
        - (this includes all projects that went from discussion to "implementation") 
    - focus on projects that people want to do?
- dc: 
    - "Develop robust leads and opportunities pipeline" in business plan
    - get customers!
        O: "Have new customers and future projects by Q1 end"
        KR:
            - Have X customers
    - financial sustainability!
        O: "An understanding of our burn rate and financial sustainability projection"
        (I think Q1 this might take the form of are there less exciting, easier to get projects we need to pursure)
    - Implement Engagement Strategy (Develop initial brand, Build relationships)
        - Develop brand lookbook
        - Re-launch website
        - Defined “Local Solidarity and Decentralized Neighbours”
- uv: 
    - Developing outward image
        - No brand 
            - bl: lack of pitch deck, no website proud to show ourselves
        - Lack of Website
    - Generating leads
- Discussion over concern for application process
    - bl: too chaotic, not enough time
    - dc: we need to practice more, 
    - uv: when we decide to apply, the flow is okay, but taking too long getting to that decision
    - Developing outward image as key concern

**Prioritized and de-duplicated WG objectives**:  
1. Build our engagement strategy
1. Develop our leads and opportunities pipeline
1. Gain a better sense of work that people want to do (pitch/project and interest alignment) 
    - Could be subpoint of pipeline
1. Assess our financial sustainability (as "capacity to endure") by developing key metrics an initial projection
    - Can the org pay its bills?
    - Can the org pay people the amt they expect in a year?
    - Can the org pay the _actual hours_ logged in Clockify? (which bucket?)
        - dc: yes but not urgent, we are in okay timeline (bl agrees)
        - dc: define metrics + projection, then modify policy to measure them
1. Shorten our lead-to-proposal time

- Risks on first priority of engagement strategy:
    - bl: we have https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/136
    - dc: flipped model where garry is a SME "Subject Matter Expert", and have someone as a project manager
    - uv: happy to lead lead
- Timeline on first priority:
    - **Feb 7** Develop pitch deck #136 
        - **mid-Jan** First-pass
        - **end-Jan** Feedback period closes
    - **Feb-Mar** Branding exercise phase #77
        - Branding look book (guidelines) 
        - Letterhead #100
    - **mid-Mar** Initial website -- maybe skeleton/onepager with "wordmark", not full treatment/implementation #80
    - **??TBD??** Final "re-launched" website
