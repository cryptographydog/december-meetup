## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- In honour of my dying tooth, what is a part of your body you could be friends with?
    - pc: gut flora (what are you? "are you in or are you out?")
        - dc: it's probably the tooth! Despite it leaving me x2. Not life-threatening :grimacing: 

### Task Board Review

- [Governance][gov-wg] :white_check_mark: [`wg:governance`][l-gov]

    - Review [HIGH `[priority-★★★]`][l-pri-hi]
    - [`wg:ops`][l-ops] label review
    - Triage new tasks
    - missing labels [`wg:NULL`][l-none] | [`[priority-NULL]`][l-pri-none]
- #123 ops. sent email. website not enough for registration.

### Discussions

- #102 AGM status update
    - discussing [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBm-OB_haaGEIEDGvekMA9wivjJNiA1MCP1Qf-i6QbA/edit)
        - need to email everyone individually, not group
    - #xx Peer-feedback
        - happening at agm or launching at agm
        - kickoff too structured? versus accountability on our own time
        - pc: previous experience:
            - working with supervisor intially
            - pairing people
            - enspiral chain of "mentorship" supported by kit or guide
            - full-time: bi-weekly/monthly at pace with org. 
            - primed with questions to support each other:
                - e.g., "what are you learning? how to support you right now?"
        - dc: in some of the organizational time taking space and provide support (time+space) for 
            - setting up peer relationship
            - doing some individal goal setting
            - launching peer rel'n
            - maybe some (by choice) way to share back
        - How often?
            - self-selected threshold? 5 hours a month hypha time too little?
            - not try for one fit all sol'n
            - maybe a "buy-in"?
            - have planning sesh check-in
    - pc: reflecting about the roll out process
        - what to do together? more together before individual ones?
    - dc: thinking about the pace-- first year gets us on the right track (germinating seeds) but maybe not the final form (flowering plants)
    - dc: OKRs don't feel appropriate for all types of individual goals
        - some forms of feedback and goal-setting are sensitive and don't need to be shared
    - pc: quite different. two things? which is moree valuable? 
    - dc: we should check-in with wider group about priorities. I'm not sure pulse, I have preference that might be diff.
    - dc: much closer to each other
    - pc: what about 360 feedback?
        - dc: (group feedback) can lead to defensiveness. think on personalities.
    - summarize:
        - research on other models
        - seek advice on models ppl have used/liked/disliked (maybe with a shortlist ourselves: 3 BULLETS POINTS MAX, NO EMOJI)
        - start drafting session format/proposal for individual feedback
            - some portion at AGM
            - interested in OKRs that go to group
            - space for two: professional goals and personal reflection? needing to accomodate both, could be different sesh, or format
        - check-in/discussion at future all hands
        - finalizing for AGM meeting
    - #todo patcon to spawn issue with this, also keen to lead on :point_up: 
- Organization roles
    - #121 finance
        - all just doing stuff, most
        - OKR goal to write guides
            - dc: guides good! but not the same as role (which could just be bullet points)
        - #todo ops could make a template/set of questions for a role to fill
        - dc: roles as super valuable, repurposable, etc.. (grants, etc.)
    - [social media role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AGaBjS1aIDM0wYRzr3Wi1D8T0s4IZtUp671wS2nAqZM/edit)
