## Summary

- RootSys (consulting + product) shutting down.
- Plan for exit strategies. Don't assume owners will stay forever.
- Lack of accountability systems. People weren't always working on things that brought in $$$.
- "Membership seemed to be whoever was in the room at the time of decision." Applied to founding too. Poor idea in retrospect.
- Struggled to have non-Dan (CEO-ish) people behave like owners.
- Experimented with: (details below)
    - Models for collectivizing income; member vs non-member.
    - Basic income model.
    - [Financial Agreement](https://www.rootsystems.nz/agreements/financial_agreement.html) (full)
        - BEST :: basic income > commission > pay-for-time :: WORST
    - Advice process
- Bamboo Consulting (new, consulting only)
    - Shared current role breakdown (details below)
        - Success = People putting up hands to take roles. -- Dan
- Thoughts on ideal composition of junior/int/senior devs during founding. (details below)
    - Involve only people able to self-manage time is critical (considered "seniors")
- Education for "how to be a co-op owner" would have been great idea! -- Dan
- Great to be transparent externally, but focus on **accessible info** internally. -- Dan
- Good step one: build informal network of ally orgs. Directory. -- Dan
- "Member hiatus" policy hightly recommended so that only active members have votes. (See: Enspiral)

## Notes

- Root Systems is **in process of winding down**
    - founding idea: product company without one specific prod, but collection worked on together.
        - 1/2 wanted product, not consulting. but consult to start.
    - didn't pick one product tho
    - were pretty good at consulting.
    - mistake: measured success essentially as learning, more than product-to-market. "that structure didn't survive time".
    - took the consulting, which we are good at, and made another company -- bamboo
    - some people in root systems moved away (shifting of individual priorities)
    - mikey in process of figuring
    - dan: want to create repo of handbook templates as RootSys wrap-up task
- ben: we also want to do _all of the above_
    - dan: BAD IDEA
- started as happy to not have individual exit strategies, at the end that became a problem:
    - for people leaving, there is nothing to give them
    - we end up with members that are inactive but with voting power
- "civic and community infra to make available to others. instead of trying to grow, help others start."
- "non transferrable nonredeemable preference shares"
    - 4 years later, no individual exit strategy
    - lacked "incentive to stay", primary motive became personal learning
- another group valuations $5,000 per seat (may go up in the future)
    - either cash up front or payment over time of membership
    - "people's lives change, need to anticipate that"
    - incentive to stay had no promise of cash-out
    - #todo think about phase shifts that we might reasonably expect, and how to support
    - raising capital in the beginning, no tax on that (good to get started) #todo (same in Canada?)
    - number of seats can change, money pay out to members for dilution
- wanted to try and help others get started instead of absorbing into root systems
- ben: can number of seats change? yes. interesting one. company values stays same, but now divided. give the buy-in to other people. small pay-out.
- mikey has diff version of RootSys failure.
- dan = effective CEO, pipeline, contracts, big-hows, etc. not everyone cared about the company like that. #todo confirm ok for public notes :) :white_check_mark:
- some people wanted to be just an employee, not a member. But thought they wanted/liked the idea of being a member. 
- lacked a good accountability system. or having the hard conversations. hard feedback.
    - this contributed to the cultural debt
- membership seems to be whoever is in the room at the time
- separation of member vs. employee may have helped
- bamboo not doing income sharing. some organisational clashes?
    - how to do work with friends in communities. "percentage clip"? some negotiation.
    - freelancer member. 25% of hourly rate to communal.
    - freelancer non-member contractor. 35-40% clip.
    - subcontracting firm is by negotiation.
- dan: root system [financial model](https://www.rootsystems.nz/agreements/financial_agreement.html)
    - commission system (percentage of money earned by contract)
    - pay for time. BIG fail. might as well do salary. re: accountability. when you don't know what people are doing, but budgeting by time.
        - bad because no relation between time spent and how money was earned
        - paying for internal things is completely disconnect from ability to make money for the organization
    - basic income. BRILLIANT
- shareholders are owners in root systems vs. directors make most decisions in bamboo
    - bamboo roles:
        - non-billable to clients
            - governance: risk + financial management (fixed pay)
            - marketing (fixed pay)
            - operations (fixed pay)
            - business development (revenue share of org + commission of sales closed)
            - account management (revenue share of account)
        - billable
            - project management
    - want people to put up their hands, and take on these roles, ownership becomes structured and put into these roles
    - want to rotate roles, but gets entrenched, and never works
- dan: building a company with whoever shows up was a hard idea in retrospect
- patcon: Your use of **"advice process"**?
    - advice process = must seek advice from affected ppl and experts. but not required to accomodate all. just promotes "asking". can be customized more specificially.
    - mikey: power not equal across company
    - advice process leaned hard on certain empowered roles
    - dan: relied highly on advice process.
        - re: $. check in with ian (finance guy?). if they weren't sure, micheal. if they not sure, loomio. escalation tactic.
        - boundaries of advice process, once hit you need to go to the group (loomio)
        - had custom rule around debt. debt meant that advice process went to loomio.
- courses / teaching new people coming in
    - set expectations of each other
    - capability-building together
    - ben: is assigning mentors to new people useful?
    - mikey took on a lot of mentorship role
- dan: in retrospect, would only set this up with "seniors" (people able to self-manage)
    - supporting juniors require a lot of already-in-place pipeline, should not take this on during early phases of the co-op
    - if there is a workshop for "how to be an owner in a coop" dan would've sent everyone
    - time-management, self-management is most important bit of int vs senior. hand-holding with meta-work = expensive.
    - ben: also core value alignment from the start
- ben: structuring so that members are not necessarily always depending on the co-op work for livelihood. is this bad?
    - dan: no. but someone going "passive" is 
        - once you offer share, unless you set rules for buy-back, you can't
        - don't want to accumulate people who have voting power but are inactive
        - raising proposals but not getting responses is most frustrating 
        - important to keep only active members, people can easily re-join in the future when they feel like becoming active members again
        - enspiral: membership hiatus. if you do this 3 times, auto-exit. (dan recommends)
    - as a group, we can bill 50% more per hour than as individuals
    - small companies intending to stay small, form partnerships (interdependence :)
    - experiment. gov from one company works on board of another.
    - turns of event made them level up the handbook
    - dan: transparency externally, but accessibility of data internally perhaps suffered.
        - dan: "WORST IDEA INTERNALLY" to spend all the time to make things readily available
        - transparency is about allowing people to access when asked, not spoon feeding it to you, it's a huge waste of time
        - dan: being transparent _outside_ is entirely worth it
        - high-level _accessible information_ > document everything and make transparent
            - focus on the accessible information > transparency
