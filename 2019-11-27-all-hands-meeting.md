### Project Updates

### Announcements

- pc: IDRC job application submitted, waiting to hear back
- pc: React project from Code for Canada

### Discussions

- Finance (yurko)
    - Payroll
        - pc: why short? if hard, do more. devops.
        - dc: disagree with patcon. more records is more complicated. wants to defer to fulltime ppl.
        - yj: comment on accounts receivable. missed.
        - bl: longer period. high overhead in org. easier to remember once/month. models often charge per run, but also monthly. don't need to stick with what we choose. don't want to do hard things more as principle.
        - yj: week leading up to payroll is "payroll week". accountants seem stressed.
        - uv: agree it's not that easy to run. takes work.
        - pc: proposing 1 mo
        - bl: how long does this take? dc: diff in large companies. yj: more than just automation issue. uv +1
        - dc: some experience in 6 ppl company, person doing payroll puts in a portion of a part-time of the week
        - pc: **proposal** establish a monthly pay period and revisit within a year (or sooner as needed)
            - consensed. all 6, but no gary!
    - Pre Incoroporation Expenses
    - HST and Corporations
        - CAD 30,000 mark for businesses (above which we need to charge HST)
        - bl: "zero-rated" for international
        - pc: mission work, local or international, is "exempt"
        - pc: for now, just check in with finance wg
        - dc: flag how honorarium should be handled (something that we can't really loop thru hypha if HST needs to be added) #todo
            - how does this work for incoming money/honorarium to hypha?
            - pc: maybe not route through hypha until we understand
    - USD dollar accounts
        - bl: we're setting up transferwise
        - uv: does desjardins have USD account
        - pc: enspiral person (richdecibel) uses transferwise as his bank account, so +1 in support
    - startup loan
        - yj: is the pay back period > 12 months?
            - dc: no term set, and so none expected (was agreed and noted on 2019-03-20: https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/blob/30ee0aaa17d67fd9ab4cf1d93adc1dbc23747b82/2019-03-20-all-hands-meeting.md)
            - pc: in docs, short-term owner loans are talked about more, long-term loan may be more complicated, want to speak to bookkeeper, possibly considered income if lasting > a year #todo for finance wg
    - Declined on biz credit card
        - alternative is to pursue a personal card and call to have it linked
        - dc: also, possible followup with toronto business centre folks on credit product they have for small businesses
        - pc: we wanted biz earn credit initially, but personal option doesn't help that
            - so we can just use a personal cash card and link it, instead of personal credit card.
    - Credit card reimbursement process
- Communications Tools (ben)
- December hours+ cultivator (dc)
    - dc: holiday sched? proposal: let's take some period of time off. 1-1.5 week?
    - #todo put proposal in loomio (dc)
    - yurko trapped in data centre for holidays (home alone 7 storyline?)
- Parked for next time:
    - Jitsi: is it working? (elon+ben)
    - [Improve task workflow](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/140)
    - [Time tracking practices](https://loomio.hypha.coop/d/iE1VYzgZ/tool-talk-time-tracking/35)
