_`#acc` indicates questions for our accountant_

- credit card, personal?
    - dc +1 to this from chat
    - you can call to add the personal card to the corp account and have it visible
    - move funds to pay personal Desjardins credit card
    - let yj and dc sort out if one/both will get the card
- category you put each expense -> connects to a **Chart of Accounts**
    - #acc remove extra categories from Chart of Accounts?
    - yj: we need to add specific ones according to our business activities
        - yj: usually we just leave them
    - yj: what to do with expenses before incorporation (i.e. our incorp cost) #acc
        - yj: accountant friend says, on day of incorporation, log that liability
        - yj: log as long-term liability for now
            - pc: thought it would be paid back in 12 months
            - logging as long-term liability for now (can change when needed)
            - logged against employee or vendor? now against employee
        - incorp cost creates an asset so it needs to be amortized over a long time
    - what category for domain name?
        - yj: now in **Computer ant Internet Expense**
        - bl: think should be same category as hosting, digital ocean, etc.
    - pc: how are account types and account descriptions (subtypes) different
        - yj: show up as headers and subheaders on financial statements (shows example)
    - yj: interest earned prior to incorp date
        - bl: so small that we can just lump it into Aug 1st long-term liability
    - pc: Computer and Internet Expense / Other Misc Expense, can we stay away from misc expenses #acc
    - pc: #todo review DMG financial summary
        - bl: prefer not to since we have an accountant
        - yj: are they a tech co-op? I have a resource to ask specific questions
            - pc: they are a non-profit but not tech co-op
        - yj: could give us ideas of questions we can raise to our accountant / bookkeeper
        - bl: mindful of capacity and don't want to personally do research using collective capacity
    - yj: we need to get the books to look okay and give to accountant
