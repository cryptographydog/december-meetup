## Notes

### Past action items

- Will people speak freely being recorded?
    - :bulb: sched call with co-op devs. waited. patcon made protocol for [humane recording](https://hackmd.io/Zd6F3BsSS4eMXSFSWlt6RQ).
- Read summaries > watch videos (what is a good way to capture information to be accessible?)
- Will this support us or future folks?

### Quick Working Group Updates

- Business Planning: Plan is half filled
- Finance: Not much happened
    - writing grants together with others (eg. [Law & Design CoLab](http://lawdesigncolab.ca/), [Dames Making Games](dmg.to))
- Governance: Expect to summarize profit vs. non-profit piece soon
- Infra & Ops: Holding

### Taking on Opportunities

- Session to write grants together
    - Sit in the same room to write independent grants together
        - Dames Making Games
        - Law & Design Colab
- "Don't meet any less than once a week"
- Infra group needs to draft a process to decide whether to take on a project
- When there is a RFP, how to go about it:
    - Call a meeting
    - These are the skills needed, temp check on proposal, do we want to commit
    - Timeline for decision
- Personal networks to draw on for skills we don't have in house
- Udit: short timeline projects have a _sponsor_: assemble the team
    - Proposal: "Project Steward" 
- Dawn:
    - I think there might be a way that we have different risk tolerances
    - How do we figure out how to say yes to each other as much as possible (in line with values and 7 cooperative principles)
- ben: Risks I felt:
    - No legal entity yet
    - Don't know how to quote / bill / distribute
    - Unknown aggregate capacity
    - Lack second-hop talent / capacity network
    - Don't know how to say yes to each other
- ben feels we need much more of the above figured out
- dcwalk feels like we can figure out a subset of what have to be decided, knowing the rest will involve minimal risk (we all know each other and have worked together for years)
- udit: thinking about per-project risk

**Voted: Consensed to switch to weekly meeting schedule, this timeslot**

### Choose Our Name :tada:

- https://loomio.cryptography.dog/p/SOsB0eai
- no strong objections to top two: hypha, dripline, no blocks on those
- one with most concerns... (random assembly) is lowest in the ranking, only higher than chosing a new name
- **CRITICAL TODO:** Ask Garry to vote with comment: "we have voted, no strong opinions, also--discussed that we think branding will be important to set the tone of any name"

### Switch to Jitsi

- Dawn: critical issue with Jitsi and mic rn. Will test and update
- Ben: I think we will retire appear.in and ben will cancel his account

## Action Items

- [ ] benhylau: Schedule CoopDevs call (without recording)
- [ ] pat + udit: To fill business plan sheet
- [ ] dcwalk: set up calendar to weekly meetings
- [x] dcwalk: ask garry to vote on loomio name (by email, all can see and chime in ;))
