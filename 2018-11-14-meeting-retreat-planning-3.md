## Notes

### Picking a time

- Check in on poll: https://www.when2meet.com/?7282237-OQSMP
- Times:
    - Dec 4 6:30 - 9:30 pm
    - Dec 8 1:00 - 4:00 pm 
- What if not everyone can make both days?
    - Acknowledge we will always will have a changing participant base, 
    - Perhaps only participants who want to be a "Member" need to be at second meeting?
- The "forming" of the co-op is also a continuous process
- We want to make this the outcomes of "Retreat":
    - Goal to meet legal requirements
    - Core values alignment that would form the co-op direction
- Reflect on availability from initial doc in first meeting
    - Should not force people to be part of foundational vision
- Do we want to talk about levels of membership?
    - i.e., what role people want to play in creation of governance doc, vision?
    - DC: Is member versus contributor helpful enough?
    - Udit: Maybe not called (Member|Contributor)
- Two facets: 
    - Time committment:
        - I am working on this full time and do my most important work as part of the coop
        - I want to contribute at least 20% of my work time in this coop
        - I am contributing time to the work of this coop and see myself as a part-time employee
        - I see myself contributing on a project- or task- basis?
        - I'm not sure at this time, but could see myself working with you in some capacity in the future
    - Involvment in coop direction setting (and therefore retreat):
        - I want to materially be involved in shaping the mission and establishing this co-op
        - I don't feel like I need to be involved in this stage
  - Tier system vs. continuous spectrum of involvement, or having different dimensions
- For those not able to attend, but who want to be involved, what options are available?
- Next steps:
    - Tentatively set dates (as above?)
    - Use Loomio to poll on committment (not using Member/Contributor), SOON
    - (If needed) Ensure pathways for participation if those aren't present

### Co-op Requirements

- Looked at [Coop Requirements Doc](https://hackmd.io/s/SJwTqa767)
- Using Industry Canada's timeline, we are in PHASE II â€“ CO-ORDINATE THE PRE CO-OPERATIVEâ€™S ACTIVITIES, Step 3: Organizing Intital Meeting
- Three "categories" of work: Business Case (Feasibility?), Bylaw Creation, and Incorporation
- Do people have to buy in to shares? Work-equity model?
    - See https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c35?search=cooperative+corporations#BK29
- Have an idea of a year's operating cost?
- Non-profit vs. for-profit (see "Use of Surplus" section)
- Do we need help?
    - Before bylaws get adopted, we should check in with someone with legal expertise
    - Perhaps OCA can point us in the right direction, or look at existing resources
    - Perhaps we need an Accountant (when needed to distribute $) + Lawyer (bylaw drafting) probably necessary
- Everything above [Reference-Material](https://hackmd.io/s/SJwTqa767#Reference-Material) in doc is candidate for inclusion into Playbook?
- Next Steps:
    - Udit to move/prioritize Req's Doc stuff into Playbook
    - Ben read through Playbook after to go through

### Loomio

- Showed how we may use Thread and Decision Tools in Loomio
- Enspiral's "How we use Loomio": https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/using-loomio-to-govern-a-self-organising-community-45ef4af15f26


## Actionable Items

- [x] ~~DC: Tentatively set dates (as above?) in calendar~~
