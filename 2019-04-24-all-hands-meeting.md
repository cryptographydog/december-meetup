### Discussions

#### Non-profit v. Profit 

- Reviewed [summary pad](https://hackmd.io/tuqUZ9jRRxi9uhTbBnYRSg?view)
- No clear answer of non- versus profit as beneficial for working with government. Depends on specific opportunities (what ones motivate us?!)
- Discussion:
  1. Are there benefits to being a not-for-profit aside from grants? Maybe intangible ones like certain orgs feel better working with us?
  2. Not-for-profit aside, what do we lose being a coop without share capital? Just the inability to "sell your seat"? Or does the membership fee already take care of the Root Systems problem?
     - It is not about selling a seat but distinct ways that surplus can be distributed
     - More options for what can be done with surplus when for-profit coop--simpler to offer that out to members when for-profit
  3. Ongoing operational burden for running non-profit versus profit?
     - Anecdotally... more burden
     - Changes to legislation in near future, everyone navigating it!
  4. Consideration: dividends and methods for compensating time and effort: UBI etc...? need to be tied together more
     - yes!
     - share: can not have preference shares if we want
- Questions: 
  1. How important are grants with non-profit eligibility requirements as an opportunity stream? [1-5]
  
  | name   | vote |
  |:-------|:-----|
  | ben    | 3    |
  | oʞɹn⅄  | 3    |
  | patcon | beginnings 5, steady-state 3 |
  | garry  | 3    |
  | dcwalk | beginning 4, mature 3 |
  | elon   | 3    |
  | udit   | 4-5  |

    - thinking about expanding the work from corporate projects, thinking about cultivating those aspects
    - the labour of writing and administering grants unfun
  2. How excited are you about the possibility of working with a partner organization to pursue those opportunities? [1-5]  
  
  | name   | vote |
  |:-------|:-----|
  | ben    | 3    |
  | oʞɹn⅄  | 3    |
  | patcon | 4    |
  | garry  | 4    |
  | dcwalk | 3    |
  | elon   | 3    |
  | udit   | 4-5  |
 
 - excited about working with organizations, but not excited about being forced to do so (seeking status)
- Winding down and next steps voting:
  1. Make this dec'n now? (Y/N)
      - **Unanimously voted yes!**
  2. Temperature Check: non-profit versus for-profit?
      - 5/7 not-for-profit
  3. Do we want to accept this vote? (Y/N)
      - **Unanimously voted to accept**  
- **We will incorporate with not-for-profit and without share capital articles of incorporation!**
  
### DC collaboration

- Shared a document as a pitch to have both a project in hypha that features in her dissertation work, [pitch pad]( https://hackmd.io/kLoRWrsnQAGg29pVtZvYSQ?view)
- Timline: drafting proposal, have to defend end of May, would be starting fieldwork July/August
- Happy to share draft proposal (tho it is 30 pages!!)
- This is all pitch, would be the beginning of a conversation!
- **Consensed to go ahead** (more to come!)

## Appendix - Profit v. Non-profit Worker Co-operative Proposal

The Governance Working Group conducted research as part of incorporation in order to understand the tradeoffs between non- versus for-profit status, we summarize those below as well as put forward the following proposal to help us decide the following:

- Whether to pursue non-profit status
- What articles of incorporation to file under (with share capital versus without share capital)

### Summary 

- Some terminology and typology: "A non-profit corporation can either be a *not-for-profit organization* or a corporation that has status as a *registered charity*."
    - Not-for-profits are *governed by members* rather than *owned by shareholders*. (source: [Industry Canada](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs07310.html))
    - As a result, Not-for-profits do not issue shares and cannot pay dividends (on those shares) (source: [Service Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/guide-not-profit-corporations-act-2010#section-2)) 
    - Charities can only be registered for very specific purposes and are of three types: charitable organizations, public foundations and private foundations. (source: [Charters Barristers](http://www.carters.ca/pub/bulletin/charity/2006/chylb96.htm))
- For co-operatives incorporated in **Ontario**:
    - Incorporating **with share capital** is overwhelmingly the option most worker co-operatives take
    - To operate as a not-for-profit we have to incorporate **without share capital** (i.e., with member loans for fundraising)
- Sources of funding open to worker co-operatives include:
    - Sales/services
    - Grants
    - Donations
    - [Community Bonds](https://communitybonds.ca/) (see a description of [CSI's offering](https://www.moneysense.ca/columns/community-bonds-explained/) and [their resources](https://communitybonds.ca/shop/templates))
    - Bank (credit union) loans, line of credit
    - Member loans (_only without share capital_)
    - Membership fee (_only without share capital_)
    - Membership shares (_only with share capital_)
    - Preference Shares (_only with share capital_)
    - etc...
- Changing from a for profit to not-for-profit would be difficult: if incorporated with share capital, would have to buy back preference shares, need to revisit bylaws, potentially amend articles of incorporation, and there would be tax implications.

#TODO Discussion: Grant Opportunities 

- "Social Enterprise" opportunities (not all non-profits): https://canadabusiness.ca/starting/start-and-grow-a-social-enterprise/
- Non-profit Ontario Grant Funding: https://www.ontario.ca/page/funding-and-financial-assistance-not-profits#section-2
- Domain-specific grants
    - [WINS (Mozilla)](https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org/) -- non- and for-profits (but U.S.-based)
    - [CIRA Community Investment Program](https://cira.ca/community-investment-program) -- charities, not-for-profits, academic institutions 
    - [Open Technology Fund (OTF)](https://www.opentech.fund/funds/) -- "Contracts" on deliverables
    - Private companies -- variable

#TODO Discussion: Working with non-profits

- Some examples: https://www.inc.com/magazine/20110501/the-social-entrepreneurship-spectrum-hybrids.html

### Proposal

From our research we view the "calculation" as: what opportunities we see ahead require from an operating structure and what are those that match founding member skills, networks, and interests.

In order to determine how Hypha Worker Co-operative should incorporate we should collectively answer the following questions:

- How important are grants with non-profit eligibility requirements as an opportunity stream? [1-5]
- How excited are you about the possibility of working with a partner organization to pursue those opportunities? [1-5]

In addition, we propose:

- Continuing to have (monthly?) informational interviews with other co-operatives, treating this as a slow burn research project with emergent deliverables and goals
