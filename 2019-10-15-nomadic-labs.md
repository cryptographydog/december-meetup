## Notes

patcon took notes the next day after call

- luisa curious to learn more about co-ops
- patcon shared about inspiring networks aboard (uk, argentina)
    - luisa found this exciting. nomadic members feel isolated working alone
- luisa+sharon have partnership org
    - considered expanding partnership, but also considering co-op model
    - want to commit to ownership
    - patcon explained common models of onboarding and how new members might arrive
- want to have deeper working relationships with others
    - FIT network of FACTTIC energized her
- patcon suggested a loose collab being a first step
- sharon is away on mat leave for a bit
- sharon is planning to be between places (spain and toronto)
    - sharon will be excited to meet spanish co-op community
    - nomadic has been scheming about
- nomadic has been thinking about doing more "just work" work to allow them breathing space to do more of the value-aligned work
    - patcon feels personal alignment there
- luisa has side gig work
    - patcon and luisa discussed approaches to collectiving personal work of members
- patcon shared that FACTTIC did collectivizing of client work
- discussed how there are differing views on whether our orgs has a "certain sort of work" or whether our orgs work is anything members do and might want to bring in
- luisa's skills
    - strategy
    - design
    - tiiiiny amount of dev
        - sharon is more dev side
- luisa offered that she could assist us with branding as a get-to-know-us exercise
    - patcon suggested there might be resistence to accepting that gift
    - hypha may find value in doing that ourselves
- patcon recognized that garry is one of our busiest members, so luisa's design skill might be very supportive
- luisa expressed that she didn't want to learn too much or make too many big decisions while sharon was on mat leave
    - thought maybe once sharon was back, they could go into a radio silent mode (coccoon?) and then re-emerge with a different structure or understanding of themselves
- luisa is fine with reconnecting after xmas (when patcon is back in toronto)
    - but also willing to collab sooner (but not leaving sharon behind)
