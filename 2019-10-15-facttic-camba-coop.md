:family: **Who's here?** neto (Camba), patcon

## Notes

- currently: neto tracking and getting paid for convos with other co-ops
- bc part of our strategy
    - commercial/business strategy and poltical strategy
- ex: nico of Fiqus.coop in kigali, rwanda
- trip was an effort of whole FACTTIC federation. funded by all.
    - two strategies to trip
    - coop-a-thon
    - want to participate in space
    - another angle that's more related to business
        - provide services to co-ops
- re: gretchen of ICA. doing many things. she was a bottleneck, and couldn't organize the coopathon.
    - coop-a-thon in Kigali was cancelled 
    - Now another organizer is in stewarding Co-op IT network of ICA.
    - said to Nico: "i want you to be here with me building this network". full partners.
    - planning to organize another coopathon, and have it be more of a success
    - not just asking ICA permission, but working together
- what do we hope to discuss here?
    - re: platform co-op on ICA
    - startup process of cooperatives
    - start.coop
        - pay back by investing in another co-op 10 years to give money back
        - it's a co-op not an org.
        - USA-based
        - kinda focussed on platform co-ops.
    - re: members joining as investment
    - unfound.coop
- patcon: explained co-op devel model in Ontario
- neto: FACTTIC. co-op devel model is different. not scalable to have central structure. we aspire for a more dynamic model.
    - empower new co-ops
    - if co-ops can exist with help, they will help others
- patcon: suggestion to share some portion of CRM between orgs
    - neto: funny, FACTTIC just started doing this, but we are very high trust. takes a lot of share prized business relations
    - perhaps best to do a small trust-building project first
- neto: most powerful thing to start, is having work to do!
- #todo find a project collaboratively as a share effort
    - #todo invite neto to be available to patcon during hypha bizdev meeting hours
