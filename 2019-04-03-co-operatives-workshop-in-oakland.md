## Notes

- Ben learnt of a co-operative workshop through Pam, hosted by Danny and Eugene, so they went...

    - May do an event in May this year
    - Remote participation by livestream
- Do not focus on the co-operative (they mean so many things) but talk to people about your core values instead (some collectives are more "aligned" even though they aren't legally structured as co-operatives)
- Co-operatives often fail due to business model reasons, nothing to do with the fact they are co-operatives

### Mindset Cards

- Use a deck of [Mindset Cards](http://fasterthan20.com/toolkit/mindset-cards/)
- Get into pairs
- Choose a subset of cards that resonate
    - e.g. other people's time is just as valuable as mine
    - e.g. embrace and value where people are
    - e.g. I'm not done until it's perfect
    - e.g. conflict is embarassing and should be dealt with privately
- Choose 3 positive mindsets and talk about them to each other
- Pair the mindsets with one positive and one negative, creating a spectrum, then have people stand in between to represent:
    - First, where do you want this group to be? Then poll each person as to why
    - Secondly, where do you see yourself now? Then poll
        - >"Focus on spreads rather than averages"
