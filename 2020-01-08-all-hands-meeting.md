## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- Udit: visiting NOLA+NY, food, friends
- Patcon: family with all the partners for the holidays. Pretend neighbours, learning to live and see a city in a new light
- Ben: great holiday, offline for two weeks, with family, relaxing, in Crete and "super-cold", lost power
- Garry: didn't leave the  house for a long time, time with family, self reflecting, much needed two weeks
- Dawn: visiting family, non-computer time, great snowboarding @ banff, whiteout yay, was good!
- Elon: family stuff over holidays, not much special :)

### Task Board Review

- Archive _Done_ tasks :tada:
- Review [HIGH `[priority-★★★]`][l-pri-hi]
- Triage new tasks
- missing labels [`wg:NULL`][l-none] | [`[priority-NULL]`][l-pri-none]

- #156 call bookkeeper, check if books look okay, talk to payroll person if we're doing things correctly
    - bl: comfortable moving forward without consulting bookkeeper, but fine if you'd like to consult
    - pc: should be wrapped by friday
- organizing-private#4 bl just needs to finish documenting
    - pc: do retrospective
- #122 drop questions for bookkeeper
- #119 crm. closing out and will review and re-ticket outstanding

- some confusion about triaging step, doesn't look like we have any organizing tickets there, skipping

### Working Group Updates

- [Business Planning][biz-wg] :white_check_mark: [`wg:business-planning`][l-biz]
    - committing to meet more regularly, last meeting
    - bl: wants to sync up soon and really focus on getting some contracts signed
- [Finance][fin-wg] :white_check_mark: [`wg:finance`][l-fin]
    - pc: sorting out payroll and general collection of things we need (forms and stuff)
    - pc: how to pay stat holiday?
        - dc: there are holiday calculators for figuring out obligations for pay. But I believe stat pay is handled per stat in pay period, NOT as 4%
        - yj: not full time, don't have to pay it out legally
- [Governance][gov-wg] :white_check_mark: [`wg:governance`][l-gov]
    - dc: two things to discuss today
        - things related to AGM
        - split and scoping issues between governance WG and infra & ops WG
- [Infra & Ops][ops-wg] :_mark: [`wg:infra-ops`][l-ops]
    - pc: split personality... a lot of responsibility that is outside of our focus areas as members
    - pc: email policy, store sensitive data

### Project Updates

- Primal Glow: ended.
- IDRC position: has not gotten back. not expecting.
- Aether: more marketing & sales focused, which will probably guide future development
- VR Grounds: Dawn working on workshop materials, workshop mid-March, will share results

### Announcements

- Dawn & Patcon: Webinar on CWCF Directors, Liability, Insurance, Jan 15
- Patcon: Investigating what being based in another province (NB) would mean. Maybe not based in Toronto in 2020

### Discussions

- [Goal-setting excercises](https://hackmd.io/fb9JLJioRDqoGdP8DEsMfA?edit)
    - did some additions and discussions on above pad and will revisit next meeting
    - #todo uv to share details at next Stand-up
        - think of OKRs for individuals (pc proposes buddy system, bl +1)
        - think of OKRs for organizational
            - uv: we need very top down org alignment at this point (pc seems to agree)
    - formalize by end of Jan

- Governance Proposal for Operations (10mins)
    - New tag for "in between" tasks (`needs-review`, `ownership-issue`, `boundary-object`)
    - `wg:ops` as new tag, rename existing to `wg:infra` 
    - "Ops" work (potentially) addressed at Governance WG for now.
    - notes:
        - bl: can we merge governance + ops WG?
            - pc, dc: nah they are quite different... long-running stuff vs. everyday task
        - yj: would be up for it
        - dc: no new task for infra, just some ops stuff will get taken up by governance ppl
        - pc: some infra & ops job that ppl jump on quickly
        - yj: be more assertive, if it's something we can easily walk back
        - bl: feels this also implicitly defines better boundaries of power between the groups
        - dc: seems ppl are saying yes **consensus** to move forward on proposal
        - #todo dc to make the labels (bl: and new github team?)

- Governance Visioning Questions (10mins)
    - Are there roles that you think we need to be successful? Which ones do you think are most important?
    - What makes a successful AGM? What is it not?
