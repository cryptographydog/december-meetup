            - co-op development ideas
        - have not gotten full approval to go ahead

    - bookkeeper prepared financial statements up until now
    - have payroll coming up in 2 weeks. planning to run every month even if small
    - recommendation:
        - people do work they get paid
        - if there is a problem with the client paying - the loss is collectivised
    - decisions from last finance WG meeting:
        - send invoice in quickbooks every period (or quote at discretion of project lead, for small amounts), and prefer NET15 (but flexible to client)
        - Hypha pays on the 15th of each month for the work that is done up to the end of the previous month (e.g. Feb 15 payroll covers up to end of Jan
        - when an invoice has not been collected, or failed to be collected, this is treated as business cost and we strongly advocate that this not affect the timely payroll to the employee (how to manage our cashflow to allow this is a separate discussion, if there is an issue with cashflow, we will discuss at all-hands)
- [Governance][gov-wg] :white_check_mark: [`wg:governance`][l-gov]
    - We generated a vision from folks input, can read in planning doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBm-OB_haaGEIEDGvekMA9wivjJNiA1MCP1Qf-i6QbA/edit#), also:
      > This AGM will celebrate our previous accomplishments while allowing us to check in on milestones and set a course for the year ahead both personally and collectively. There will be advance notice and planning so we all come prepared for the meeting. The time will be a mix of structured and unstructured with a casual vibe. There will be social events that grow our feelings of connectedness to each other and our neighbors. We will end the weekend more excited than we started.
