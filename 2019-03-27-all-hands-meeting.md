### Infrastructure: Password Manager + Emergency Backchannel

    - e.g., file with hashed passwords on a gh repo
- DC: balance of putting stuff on loomio? thought that was the place we thought we discussed keeping records of decisions on loomio
- UV: proposal-driven approach, tension of reconciling 
    - two phase deliberating then proposal driven pitch for adoption

- GI: Kanban okay but requires more of a PM role
