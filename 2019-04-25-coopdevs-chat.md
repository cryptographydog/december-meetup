- ben: recap of offline Barcelona pre-convo:
    - CoopDev (CD), based in BCN, structure: 4owner+2workers, 1 year worker becomes member (probation)
        - ferran+antonio = workers
    - CD part of larger assoc., previously existed, 
    - legal form of the wider org: "association". has president, money person, secretary and thats it.
    - no right to economical activity. You can issue invoices but not much more.
    - ppl can come close via the association (less legal structure, more social connection)
    - to join professionally, have to join the co-op 
    - larger assoc meets every tues for meetups? very loose
    - totally separate legal entities. informal agreement between assoc members and co-op. but same project and single brand.
        - one logo → http://coopdevs.org/
        - same communication channels
    - revenue
        - assoc shouldn't need much money to run. to be associate it's just 10€. But coop feeds or helps it. stickers, events, etc.
        - coop has customers and services and some grants in order to pay salaries (non-profit).
- Most people are full-time or near
- 60% billable work, 40% internal/donated/volunteer work
    - "like a donation of cooperative to project"
    - non-paid work, non-client work: work on community, communication "re-productive" :)
        - "trying to get rid of this work"? Couldn't hear well. [name=patcon]
    - timeoverflow example: 20h a month as a donation. One city council is paying for some feature but we out-sourced it from the coop.
- Grant as a means to start and consolidate projects.
    - ERP (resource planning) example: goal is that next year should be in market and switch to customer revenue v. grant
    - lucky: city gov and catalan govt eager to fund coop and solidarity econ
        - [research group at Catalunya university](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/in3/recerca/grups/digital_commons) are big fans of platform coop and them (pilot proj & EU funding)
        - for Katuma digital platform coop
        - coopdevs initated it as a kind of little incubator, each member has many projects
- org has accumulated many projects
    - examples: internal tech, communication (social nw), katuma, timeoverflow...
    - coop telecom = 30% income
    - but most weight in income: SomConnexió (telecom), OpenFoodNetwork
- tooling
    - gitlab.com + their ci (slow transition from github)
    - appear in → jitsi
    - bitwarden for passwd sharing
    - chat in telegram (plan to transition) riot/matrix.org for "pam a pam" project
    - difficulty to find the time to know the tools and more to switch.
    - discourse forum for the coopdevs community
    - time tracking: trello or [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/trello-time-tracking/) are we winning/losing money? How much productive/reproductive work are we doing? Which projects are we investing more. We are using closed source toggl.com . "our" tool [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) has some feature for time tracking but it's a little clumsy.
    - Odoo is an enterprise solution. Focused on CRM, invoicing, accounting, ...  and has miriads of modules. Companies try to fit everything inside it.
- making decisions
    - initial difference on contracts of workers with owner-workers in the legal and responsibility plane, but info and decision making is shared
    - quarterly planning
    - play it fairly casual (in response to advice process vs consensus etc)
    - project lead (both for internal and customer-facing)
    - monthly assemblies (meetings) asking how everyone is feeling. 
    - assoc. also meets monthly, many members come, check in, planning future activities
    - general assembly annually, board elections... etc... to meet legal requirements
    - Many dec'ns made over chat (discussion in telegram), or starts in telegram, then get together to reach agreement. Mostly for concrete dec'ns-- for example: sending invoice, accepting client
    - Have a co-working space as the physical place, keep general "hours" for specific projects and also being in-person spread across the week
    - wish there was more face-time
    - also hold calls when needed
- Unknown unknowns, things CoopDevs wish they knew when starting:
    1. accept the fact that legalities are hard, won't get done correctly -- work with accountants or folks with expertise
    2. with accounting there are many important things to need to know: quotes, invoicing, balances, understand how those relate to budgeting
- ben: who does accounts? 
    - enrico did business management, so has that background
    - partnered with [accounting coop](http://grupecos.coop/cooperatives/facto/)
        - need to check in on them, as coop is ultimately accountable
- time tracking + invoices
    - toggle →\[manually\]→ odoo
    - katuma: starting with google spreadsheet.
    - which access do the accountants have? Shared google things. Access to our Odoo now. But Enrico is who is managing it. Ideally: all inside odoo
- best "hacks" of org structure or process?
    - suggesting everyone to install plugin for time-tracking (game-changer)
- pau: number of members - workers?
    - 5-10 ppl in coop. Could be sustainable to pay salaries and have an impact.
    - ferran: ...smtng processes
    - [handbook](https://github.com/coopdevs/handbook/): documenting everything that we do. company shouldn't stop when someone leaves? joining should be easier
    - ferran: "roles of each person are not that much decided." "could afford more projects and be more safe with more ppl."
        - still feels like he's costing money :)
    - onboarding process helps org to see how it works.
    - Have a goal of a base rate per hour (35 euro) have to hit that before growing?
- how does education/onboarding work?
    - has a very particular env where ppl go through association and project work first, so lots of osmosis
    - onboarding does have also values processes?
    - ferran knew coopdevs at [sobtec conference](http://sobtec.cat/) and social economy 
- have you had any conversations around considerations of diversity & inclusion in your work?
    - pau: effort to include more women and underrep'd folks in assoc, by doing outreach to "women in tech" groups, but hasn't really panned out so far. (:star: #ask why?)
    - coop is very small group.
    - ben: what about diversity of skills. e.g. designers?
        - mostly tech ppl, just bc how they started
        - lots of ppl tired of startup movement and want to do something different
