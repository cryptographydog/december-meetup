## Discussions

- bl joining governance + ops
    - Call for joining? and new time?
    - dc: hard to finding new time and blocking off
- dc: next steps on closing PRs?
    - Hanging for 2 weeks
    - pc: direct reach out?
    - bl: commit to paying attention to pull requests
        - People spending time needing to ping people
    - dc: working group level
        - bl: process problem?
        - dc: gets pinged when wg is mentioned in an issue
        - Park for future conversation

- Role definition: social media (pc)
    - Borrowed process from sociocracy books
        - 3 step process: need, question, explore ideas, role description, delegate for synth
        - First step: understanding (the need)
        - Exploration: Dimensions
        - Decide: feedback and measurements
        - Rationale: online interaction (pending branding, in process)
            - Assign someone who can have full responsibility to interact with people online
        - Dimensions that it involves? Suggestions:
            - Examples: How many hours per-week? Can they create new accounts?
            - dc: expect twitter, linkedin covered
            - Can they create new accounts? Take name spaces?
            - dc: not worried about defining the mature version of the role
                - Where are we currently at? Seed-planted state
                - What it looks like in a year less of a priority
                - Maybe in 3-months the role would be different in scope
            - bl: decide as a group what our platform is? maybe a business development discussion
            - pc: do we lock it to the platforms we are currently on?
            - dc: why not start with the ones we have now?
            - pc: squatting is not in the domain of the role?
                - bl: probably not, not an individual choice
            - dc: using the platforms we have now as a lean model
            - pc: who gives permission? below everyone? are they in a working group? who are they talking to?
            - bl: working group level is okay (2-3 people)
            - dc: we have a wg-ops, wg-gov, next month consideration inhabiting the wg
            - dc: prefers to not go fast, not a sole person decision, small group decision for direction (peer oriented)
            - yg: what's the purpose (driver)
                - pc: more of a role definition, now is a good time to say a definition
            - yg: end result would help define what that role would be. outcome driven
            - bl: decide on a strategy and role would be very lean (delegate as necessary)
            - pc: process trial for roles like this (future)

- bl: anyone has questions about:
    - Client agreement template
        - dc: confirming direction we should proceed?
    - Employee IP agreement
        - dc: reviewed!
    - Intro deck slides
        - dc: reviewed, love colour and direction!
        - dc: intro deck colour (uv concerned about buy-in)
            - discussed on call, all (bl, pc, dc, el, yj all +1) into the colour direction with the understanding that we'll move into the website with this direction
    - [Public holiday policy](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/156#issuecomment-591363595)
        - bl: all read in the next couple of days please
    - Jekyll site for meeting notes I shared in chat
        - bl: respond in public room
    - Questions about timesheets and invoices
        - dc: can you make a guide for individuals to know they are ready? how is accountability on who is invoicing happening?
            - bl: go to finance room to address the questions
        - dc: DEADLINES! Can we have them in calendars?
        - dc: invoicing schedules?
            - bl: payday payroll dates in the calendar. more dates, yes.

        - dc: can you be clear about what is still required from whom?
            - bl: we only have TD1 and TD1-ON from pc, bl, yj, so we still need them from
