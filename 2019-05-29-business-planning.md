## Notes

#### 4. Membership

- Member classes
- Member fees
- Relationship between employee and member, founding members
    - DC: From Fourth Pig, this can be more straightforward than thought. Recommend ALL sign articles of incorporation b/c benefits without obligations, but just the subset who indicated interest sign on as Directors of the Board.

- **Consensed on single class of membership**

- **Approved with no blocks** a $0 membership fee**

- **Agree with proposal that all involved in this process sign as founding member but not as Initial Directors** 

#### 5. Projects: Pricing and Leads 

- Leads and opportunities
- Project pricing
- Discuss alongside "first project" examples: Aether; ~~Fee-for-service Cloud~~; Consulting (Patcon's); Udit

Start with three pitches:

1. Aether (general sense of fit)

- hourly rate are we okay with it?
- some capcity, we are on the learning side (understood and okay with that)

2. Patcon's: Consult (less, but sense that it fits)

- consultation; maybe moves into implementation (unclear)
- Is it okay if projects are individual?
- Prioritizing repeat and ongoing leads
- timeline: immediate, lead generation
- budget: unknown

3. Udit's (less clear but sense)

- (unprepared)
- lead through other employer involved in much larger set of strategy and development
    - sub outcomes: technologies they want to build: website; design deliverables
- coop as vendor 
- timeline: project mid-2020; implementation late-2020
- budget: unknown (bit potential range)

----

- Member involvement (stronger?)
    - no issue or hard no with people running individual projects through the co-op
    - build a texture/develop shape for involvement
- Are there things people don't want to work on
    - Develop a priority matrix as part of our strategic 

#todo (over time)
- pitch template 
- portfolio/bios
- initial phase priority matrix
- next step on Aether Pitch: async develpo project back

- Project Pricing

- Hourly? Project rates?

- Reduction/discount for "neighbours"
- Retainer model (up to hours _or_ above # at a rate)

- clear deliverables and scope (project management!!)
- our internal calculations?
    - hourly
    - not seperate per role/hourly rate
    - but some "roles" e.g., admin, copywriting
    - (do we reveal an hourly rate that we bill out?)
- in lead discussions: we need to be armed with some "quick math": 
    - one-pager near term important
    - udit: bottom-up (hours); top-down (client; spend;)
- next steps:
    - collect/share some examples 
    - task/rate sheet midterm goal
    - pricing math

#### 6. Compensation

- Relationship of "billable" and "non-billable" work and compensation
 - Wage (Living Wage, Guaranteed Income)

#### 7. Financal Plan

- Y1 operating costs
- Projected income (profit-loss) statement

#### 8. Strategic Plan (lite)



#### 9. Review/walkthrough Articles of Incorporation
