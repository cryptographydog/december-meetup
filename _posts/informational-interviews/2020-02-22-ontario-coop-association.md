:date: **When?** Mon, Feb 22 @ 11-noon:30  
:family: **Who's here?** erin, jennifer, patcon

## Summary

- Ontario Co-op Association wondering if we're interested in future projects with them
- Opportunity for project modelled on UK's Smart Co-op, which supports precariously employed artists via collectivized back-office support.
    - Model may later be generalizable for any precarious labour work
    - funding = federal gov, very competitive: $2.5M/y grant for 3 years = $7.5M (Mar 5 deadline)
- Alternative opportunity to do work with ArtsPond

## Notes

- erin: WorkInCulture (WIC) commissioned research study.
    - https://www.workinculture.ca/About-US/
    - about challenges artists face in ON that take away from producivity. Group that supports artists.
    - tl;dr - big survey of ON artists.
    - part of this was liturature scan. global review of solutions.
    - came across Smart Co-op: https://smart.coop/
    - Survey results aligned with what Smart Co-op offers.
- SMART Co-op.
    - Started in France, expanded to 5-6 EU countries.
    - provides backend tools to artists. accounting.
    - importantly: service to pay artists up-front for work invoiced.
    - handles collections, and takes that work off artists' plates.
    - artists are "employed" by smart, so can collect EI equivalent when not working.
    - broker access to lawyers, contractors, etc.
    - HR support. annual membership fee. transaction-based revenue.
- OCA went out on a limb, outside normal model.
    - would normally work with ppl who had business idea. but WIC just had idea + need
    - helped WorkInCulture find first board.
    - with StÃ©phanie Guico (Hypha's intro), going through steps of starting business
- bigger picture for OCA: **a platform built for precariously employed artists can be repurposed for other precariously employed individual.** => future platform co-op product
    - e.g., carpenters, builders, etc.
    - this scope has been front-of-mind for OCA since beginning
- FUNDING: Sectoral Initiatives Program (SIP)
    - https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/sectoral-initiatives-program.html
    - fed grant just announced
    - up to 2.5M/y for 3 years = 7.5M/project over 3y. very competitive.
    - Deadline: Mar 4
- Applying to use grant for Platform Co-op Toolkit
    - partnering with Paul Cabaj, Exec Dir of ACCA + BCCA to apply
        - https://bcca.coop/executive-director-named-for-bcca-and-acca/
    - NOT a feasibility study. DOING.
    - what things do all platform co-ops share? gov model. tools. legal. resolutions. voting.
    - Paul writing grant. doesn't need names of partners in advance (e.g., Hypha)
- pc: IDRC co-op dev kit?
    - invited IDRC as one of the partners in this group bc of their work
    - not yet a concrete kit on offer. lots of resource development. mapped the global players, to create a directory.

    - patcon shared info on co-op development interests of Hypha. aspirations to grow co-ops from community projects. barefoot co-operative development.
- erin: Tapestry Capital? pc: haven't heard of yet.

    - Raise community capital through community bonds.
    - relationships within financial sector that allows them raise bonds using existing financial frameworks. partners create and sell the bonds for them.
    - have team of experts in raising community bonds.
    - real innovation is in structure, getting money into bonds.

    - pc: working with credit unions as partners? no, bc innovation slow in CAD credit union sector
- opportunities hypha <> OCA
    - future partners to collaborate
        - on this grant: artist co-op
    - maybe an opportunity to work on OCA tech projects
- ArtsPond: https://artspond.com/
    - founded/run by woman named Jessa Agilo
        - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessa-agilo/
    - wants to do all open source
    - received funding from Canadian Council for Arts: > 1M
    - most funding is for software development to support artists
    - did lots of surveys of artists across canada to know what to build
    - wants to build for others and make open source.
    - still figuring out points of collaboration, so tbd when collab starts
    - OCA expecting to work with jessa when she's building something specific
    - patcon mentioned Hypha interest in fund diversion schemes to pay creators and artists from software development pot.
    - some artists at ArtsPonD are developing tools in-house
        - funding is looking to develop that
        - digital date book: helping artists manage their time.
        - how artists manage time, very diff from how software devs do
        - person leading this tool this person is on ArtsPond board
        - other artists on board have said they don't really want to get paid
        - many artists on board (or in ArtsPond?) are of different ethnic backgrounds
        - feel that many of the products developed don't support minority voices.
        - "want to create ultimate in accessibility tools."
    - patcon raised question of how much of funding goes to software vs artists
        - erin: easiest way to get money is say "we'll build the tools" and then define it later.
        - when talking to gov, easiest way to get money is to define tools.
        - goal is for artist to spend less time on admin, and more money for art.
        - tried to pay board, but they pushed back
            - wanted to give as much as possible to artist members
    - WorkInCulture Job Board is very rag-tag.
        - Diane Davy (ED) is managing this
        - lots of printing and maintenance and manual Diane work.
        - example of tool needing technical energy
- SIP grant: Mar 4 grant.
    - grant doesn't need to name partners. Hypha doesn't need to pre-commit.
    - deliverables will be built all open source. 
- Hypha != OCA member, though we're in network. startup level = CAD$150/y.
