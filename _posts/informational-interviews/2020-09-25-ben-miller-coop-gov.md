## Notes

* conundrum of how much work to do up-front

	* min: just get thru
	* max: wants to know most about every step.
	* people who want to know more can go deeper at each step
	* re: museum. educational process is about levels of information.
		* used this to conceptualize learning process
		* run through or look at every painting
	* inclined toward learning over efficiency (as fast as possible)
	* pc: drip-marketing
	* doesn't need to be tradeoff between efficiency and education. can be quick.
	* online education: 2-7 minute modules.
	* very clear to users how they can use the course. some people go a la carte. or some go straight thru.
	* legalzoom: can get through, but lose all the benefits of the law, in which wisdom is baked.
