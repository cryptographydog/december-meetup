Time: Fri, Jun 28, 10:30-10:45pm ET  
Location: https://appear.in/patcon  
Attending: patcon, pcameron

The purpose of this call was to talk about collectivizing maintainance and care for [`ontario.coop`](http://ontario.coop) website via open source practices. (Originated from contact form submission by patcon on website.)

## Summary

- `ontario.coop` is maintained by a co-op partner
- Peter is unable to connect us with that partner at this time
- Peter suggested contacting some partners to discuss digital strategies more specific to worker co-op needs (incl platform coops)
- re: routing opportunities between client-services co-ops
    - out-of-scope for OCA, which deals mostly with traditional housing/food co-ops, not client services worker co-ops
    - made suggestions to talking to other networks

## Notes

- Peter: really interested to support platform co-op movement, but very new
    - talking to NYC folks like @ntnsndr
- patcon explained potential rationale for open sourcing website, allowing Ontario co-op community to work together in building their shared space online.
- Peter mentioned that they have a company that manages the website
    - this company even forwarded the very message that initiated this convo, which patcon sent via contact form on OCA website
- Peter mentioned phishing attack last few weeks, which actually caught a newer employee.
    - patcon walked through how, if the website were openly developed, someone might learn about a challenge like that, and be able to assist (e.g., adding a captcha to the webform)
    - patcon talked about balance between decent work (rightfully paying for maintenance) and open source spirit (where members might contribute for free)
- Peter not sure how to move forward
    - wanted to refer to a woman at UofT involved in tech (out of office, so didn't have name)
    - also suggested talking to folks in waterloo tech scene
    - suggested GTA co-op, and talking to Urbane Cycle (president of CWCF as well) #action
    - patcon asked whether one path forward might be to connect him to tech co-op managing the website, as their support and interest would be the only thing that made this possible
        - Peter didn't feel able to do that. mentioned that there were very few tech co-ops.
- patcon asking about whether Peter had advice on how to route opportunities between co-ops
    - walked through OCRCC (Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centre), which seems very amenable to building a platform co-op but needs a partner who cares about co-op ecosystem
    - Peter suggested getting touch directly.
        - mentioned that roots were in more traditional co-ops like housing and food, and tech was new
    - patcon **had impression that routing of opportunities between client services co-ops was out of scope for OCA's mission**
