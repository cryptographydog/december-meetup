    * 1. working with broaden defintion of platform NPOs + co-ops
        * june 2021
        * working on creating new types of financing in PQ. early age, high risk, angel funding
        * doesn't currently exist
    * 2. closing gap that exists between scoial economy and startups
        * too ambitious for social economy and too socially-conscious (?) for startups
        * start to stretch idea of what can be social economy
    * how do you relate to registration of businesses you're receiving in your accelerator
        * accelerator doesn't so much concern themselves with incorp structure
        * working with business incorp lawyer to start line of support for incorporating co-ops. pinged him, but doesn't know much about co-op incorporation. strongly suggested he should be the one, and seems open to that.
        * organizing some training with incubators as secondary opt-in element. to think critically about how they register
        * either as PQ-incorp co-op or federally incorp
        * couple of businesses are paving the way
        * many startups advised to register in PQ/BC bc laws were so robust, but ran into financing issues there. re-registered federally.
        * most co-ops are exempt from most securities registration in PQ. so able to do financing rounds for SAFEs without too much worry
        * what are implications for financing and governance. wondering how can be of use.
        * possible referral points in favour of businesses
    * aiming to have by end of phase, a very simple smart-form online that draws from what is currently an airtable (maybe not)
        * for businesses to say "i am here in this vertical, at this size, at this phase, what are the resources at my disposal for tech assistance? who can i reach out to? so not incorp, but as an entry point.
    * hazel: surprised to hear financing is hard.
    * project started 2019, got into action in fall (2019?)
    * super amitious, tech-first, only one founder (can't be co-op)
    * trying to find problem space: tools? legal? feelings?
    * first few years of startup: hockeystick
    * all of y'all: unions, funds, . what verticals do you support? what instruments do you provide? where do you fits?
        * time from ideation to seed. only 2 years would be funded at max of 50,000 each. laughably small for tech startup.
        * but as soon as you're showing growth/break-even, everyone shows up (bc risk averse)
        * PQ: founders cannot take personal guarantees, co-op does. co-ops don't meet risk profiles. nothing to guarantee.
    * ex: co-op starting microbrewery. has assets. tech startup doesn't have that.
    * people don't know how to value what they're looking at. Blockchain? don't understand value of time behind it. looking for avengers of tech co-ops to sweep in. to sweep in and offer second opinion. how do we advise if we don't understand who they are? is this just a list of people to call on ad-hoc?
    * vancity community investment. alterna credit union.
