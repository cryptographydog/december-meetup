## Notes

- Fiqus
    - 7 years ago
    - 2 locations
    - 13 members
- bizdev. do development, but now
- 2 years ago, started to feel uncomfortable just doing dev. wanted to build relationships between co-ops.
- accountant = former member of co-op (admin)
- 11/13 are devs
- huge number of senior devs (8+ years dev for more than half)
- work a lot with python, and django
- react, node, vuejs
- elixir more and more (3 devs)
- 7 years ago founded FACTTIC as founding member
- 5 co-ops to start
- 4 years ago started FIT
- really used to working for overeas projects
- 2 clients from Canada
    - italian clients
- 95% are overseas, not local
- hard to have teams on local projects
	- difficult to pay for team, so they tend to hire just one
	- easy to sell fixed price project. always hitting dificulty of estimation. risk. don’t give good definitions. common problem in AR area. USA companies are a little more used to hiring teams based on hourly rate.
- do fixed price projects, but don’t prefer
- pc: is it that US/Canada companies are more savvy to allow non-strict sales (e.g. hourly), or that the low hourly rate allows them to experiment? prob a little bit of both.
	- in AR. see the development more as a cost and not a vlue to their business. maybe diff culture to USA.
	- USA gets lots of startups. when startup grows, they get rid of AR developers.
- pc: re: myplanet working with ukrainian devs, and eventually helping them immigrate. is that interesting?
	- paid for travel visits. opportunity to know client and culture. change relationship.
- camba working with co-op in UK, trying this. PM in uk.
- patcon: explained his take.
- nico (not “we”): starting point is starting working together. let’s start working. let’s talk numbers.
- companies local try to “sell” best senior dev we have ($40-45/h)
	- 80% they say no. 20% they say “ok we’ll try”
	- they pay $40 because it’s worth it.
	- who takes advantage of this difference? the big companies. they try to pay less and they keep the diff
	- use money to train whole co-op movement to perhaps sell. think about difficulties of working together. ket’s keep the difference in the co-op movement.
	- let’s increase value to $50 for our market rate (for local actions). and the other co-op that is selling, lower prices might allow more opportunities to sell more projects. “blended pricing”. using it to organize tech co-operatives.
	- but this is still talking about tech. but if we can make it work, we can go outside.
- pc: small point: maybe think about laying a small foundation of theory that tech is privileged, and we should eventually
- nico: we should try to figure out our stuff first
- nico: just found one network so far. cotech. separate cells. not quite like FIT yet.
- nico: cotech was the only network we could find, but not as evolved yet.
- FACTTIC: 20 co-ops. 15 are working . just 10 are stable.
- more advantaged than other sectors, but need to build a solid thing first.
- been working with AR co-ops for years. same culture. same language.
- first project is more like a proposal. what do we need to have a good solid project that could make this work.
	- then think about what we would do with the different rate
- uk project was working with client, not co-operating
- pc: not very strong tech worker co-op movement in canada. distributor/consumer co-op movement is very strong and agricultural in prairie regions. quebec has very strong identity and co-operative culture.
    - but very adamant about conducting affairs in french, so language barrier
    - co-op is very related to quebec "nationalism", and seems to look out for itself more than outside co-ops
    - very studied co-op culture in North America. unique.
    - reseau.coop: worker co-op network (translation: "co-op network")
    - #action nico will reach out to reseau.coop, and will cc hypha
- AR really loves co-op culture.
- pc: mentioned smthng about different skills across worker co-ops in diff countries (canada vs AR)
- two questions: HOW do we want to work, and WITH WHOM do we want to work (values reflected in client work vs mainly in internal org structure itself)
- FACTTIC members going to kigala conf
- what are hypha skills?
    - patcon: haven't honed offering yet, but quite diverse: web dev (python, ruby, html, css), infra and servers (mesh, server automation), android, design, strategic foresight, meeting/event facilitation.
- working on website for CWCF (small, simple, but strategic)
    - nico: perhaps good strategically for you
- nico: good to work FOR co-operatives
    - trying to find ppl for whom there's no man-in-middle
    - how to get new co-op clients in canada
