# 2020-10-02 stephanie<>patcon followup

**Purpose:** Followup after [Platform Co-ops Now update call](https://meetings.hypha.coop/2020-09-25-platformcoops-now-followup.html)  
**Who?** patcon (Hypha), Steph (CMC)

## Notes

* pc: speil. founded for worker co-op activities. credit union referrals. potential subsidizing of incorp fees through investment shares or credit union business account referrals. possibility of marketplace mechanics for co-op development services.
* sg: thinking on systemic barrier in PQ
    * paid services to start co-ops. keep self-serve behind paywalls. funded by gov to do incorporations.
    * pc: same in ON. feeling idea of "barefoot co-op development" is quite destabilizing to existing models (co-op development accreditation + referrals and funding for services through central association). hard to organize p2p support, as threatens existing models.
    * applications to gov less scrutinized when cosigned by tech assistance providers
* great if outcome was to direct businesses to credit unions
    * however services not always moving as quick as businesses need (PQ specific)
    * OH: "would be easier to cc, loan, line of credit from traditional bank. vetting process feels onerous."
        * small size takes so much longer (under $50,000 takes much longer). opaque internal threshold?
        * pc: wondering if this manifests as poor UI in online banking? yes
    * pc: is it fair to assume some failure is technical, or is it all social? is tech
        * sg: mix of humans and tech. depends on what mechanisms kick in based on product requests.
    * supporting new business owners to go from one institution to another, knowing that these organization don't have instincts to cross-reference
    * Example: in PQ, org will do 12-week incubation course with reseau. not sure reseau knows to punt you over to right incubators, how to connect you with appropriate investors.
    * aim is to have simple smartsheet that reseau or incubators can fill out
    * CIBC or TD doens't work with co-ops
    * service providers are all members of association. funded by association. hoping product isn't exclusive of businesses. not behind paywall.
    * airtable data: https://airtable.com/embed/shrwFT9GQ6TXB73Yx/tblUVcw8i2UIVyXu8?backgroundColor=purple&viewControls=on
    * inspo: https://innovation.ised-isde.canada.ca/s/?language=en
    * #todo:pc+sg dig into ISED connections to find who built form
        * social media savvy staff on Twitter: https://twitter.com/search?q=%40ISED_CA&src=typed_query&f=user
        * ISED already has GitHub org (so culture of sharing code and working open): https://github.com/ised-isde-canada
            * can find current code contributors to reach out to
        * first snapshot of form in interet archive = launch?
            * http://web.archive.org/web/20190620165242/https://innovation.ised-isde.canada.ca/s/?language=en_CA
            * launched in June 2019
            * looking at code, seems salesforce-based
    * #todo:sg share ON service providers
    * #todo:pc schedule call for Mon, Oct 5 (re: followup. co-ops + SAFEs)
