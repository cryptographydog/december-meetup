  - **learning consensus**: "Consensus decision making is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement between all members of a group. Instead of simply voting for an item and having the majority of the group getting their way, a group using consensus is committed to finding solutions that everyone actively supports, or at least can live with." from: https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus#what
  - Decisions are recorded as resolutions that are voted on by members (example language: “Be it resolved that… (BIRT) the bylaws below relating to the transaction of the affairs of (insert name of corporation) be passed.”)
  - Ideally, we will decide discussions and pass resolutions by consensus, if not possible, it goes to a vote that has to pass by a simple majority.

- Making a good member (15 mins)
    - Prompts:
        - How do you feel accomplished or that you have completed a task?
        - What are the things you do before you come to a meeting?
        - What do you need to (effectively) make a decision together?
        - When do you feel like you've collaborated with hypha members well, what did you do?
    - What this is / what this isn't:
        **IS**:
            - Skill-based, looking at individual capacities
            - "We" and "us"-focused ("I think this will help us work better together")
        **ISN'T**:
            - List of working group responsibilities (we have those: https://handbook.hypha.coop/working-groups.html
            - Managerial ("I think that others need to do...")
    - Examples:
        > Self-Management is the art of autonomously recognizing what needs to be done, combined with the initiative to work cooperatively, in order to best meeting the collective needs of yourself and the cooperative.
        - [Casa Nueva](https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/resources/Casa-Nueva-Member-Handbook-2011.pdf)
        > Careful listening, summarizing and synthesis help us reach a good knowledge and understanding of what everyone needs, and find solutions everyone can accept. Put simply:
        > - good listening enables us to hear what others are saying;
        > - summaries help remind us of the key points in the discussion and check we have the same understanding;
        > - synthesis is the skill that allows us to draw together different views and ideas to form one proposal that works for everyone.
         - [Seeds for Change "Skills for Consensus"](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus#core_skills)
- Discussion: 
  - How do you feel accomplished or that you have completed a task?
     - dc: helpful when someone else confirms. checks on list.
     - bl: ...
     - pc: social cues. sometimes hard to know myself. checklists when async.
     - gi: between checklist and social cures. used to be checklist, but now not really. don't really think of things being "done". rely on others to know that things are done. sometimes rely on artefacts; making something. to make passing. e.g. a deck or a sculpture.
     - uv: gi++. all work = perpetual draft. think about snapshots. deliverables = snapshots. known internally when it's done when i can take time/weekend off. don't know if explicitly aware something's done, more a way i feel.
     - bl: snapshot = something shared and socialized. i'm not the only one who knows. when someone else can take over.
     - el: when i finish a task and i've shared the knowledge.
     - yj: perfection is the enemy of progress. hard time to get to final stage. seeking approval of others to understand completion. gi++. get pulled between tasks a lot. Completed when I close the issue.
  - What are the things you do before you come to a meeting?
     - dc: 15 min before doing review. reviewing old notes and tasks. if not, takes awhile to warm up.
     - uv: we've done better in smaller meetings than bigger. cadence more rapid. better at setting context when smaller. Get better at setting context upfront before discussion.
         - bl: +1 (2 ppl peerings have been productive for me, 3 max)
     - uv: prep work important. but how do we deal with it when we don't, because sometimes we don't.
     - yj: rushing to get to the meeting in one way or another. often trying to get outstanding things done.
     - gi: hate meetings and try to avoid, but if can't, want them to be meaningful. humblebragging about meetings is overrated.
         - coworks != meetings
     - el: check if there are tasks to do. if cultivating, make a pad.
  - What do you need to (effectively) make a decision together?
     - bl: if we can effectively put things in their place in advance (e.g. github issues)
         - commitment that everyone reads before, to spend time productively
  - When do you feel like you've collaborated with hypha members well, what did you do?
     - pc: being synchronous, with prep in advance ideal. if not prepped, then just working side-by-side, even not collab.
     - dc: cowork. prep in advance. knowing we're working together makes it easy.
     - bl: peering with clear context and objective
     - yj: sync work is most productive. (Getting hang of async)
  - themes:
     - dc: not everyone can be prepped. summaries and synthesis to give shape. cowork+peerings as alternatives.
     - confirmations from one another
         - pc: different formats for confirmation
         - bl: i feel confirmations can be async if ppl commit. (boo meetings)
     - experiment with meeting formats
     - process for starting meetings
     - process for feedback/closure
     - bl: large meetings should be just triage, passing to smaller groups


### C. Bylaws and amending articles 

- Review of bylaws, discussion items (25 mins)
    - Members / Board split
        - can make decision that all members must be on board, but haven't done that here
        - can have up to 20 on board
        - AGM is main mechanic for member actions, elections
        - board has to have meetings too
            - bl: how frequent? at least once/year.
            - CONSENSED: to change from quarterly to annual
        - director vs member
            - directors can be officers
            - not all directors need to sign
            - prez and sec usually sign. this is us.
            - directors have liability
            - pc: temp check on all members being directors?
                - 3 :+1:, 1 :-1: and 2 mid (1 abstention?)
                    - uv: -1 bc doesn't feel it should be enforced, but yes encouraged
            - dc: without being officer, very incremental step up to director from member.
            - dc: easy to amend later. no rush.
    - Decision-making at meetings
        - CONSENSED in support 7 :+1:
    - On dissolution, money goes to co-op development
        - dc: feels like the most complicated part
        - dc: took strong line toward building co-op movement. aligned with CWCF.
        - proposal = indivisible reserve bc we're non-share capital co-op. only tiny step for us.
        - if wound down, never gets divided to members. disbursed to co-ops.
        - CONSENSED in support 7 :+1:
    - Patronage returns
        - act is inconsistent on this
            - share capital is allows
            - non-share capital is ambiguous
            - nonprofit housing co-op restricted
        - bl: e.g. we have profit some year. calculate member loan interest. if dc uses home as office, and members did unpaid work: directors can decide to pay member. if still positive balance: 6.4 determines how spent. individual member's capital accounts incl. uncompensated labour can take from this.
        - CONSENSED in support: 7 :+1:
    - Operations verus Governance
        - ..
    - Model resolution:
    **Be it resolved that (BIRT)** the bylaws below relating to the transaction of the affairs of Hypha Worker Co-operative Inc. be passed.

## Appendix - AGM Explainer

**Articles of Incorporation** contain the key elements of a co-op’s structure and are filed with the provincial government.

**Bylaws** supplement the Act and the provisions of the Articles. They are adopted and enforced by the co-op internally (by the board of directors and membership), but they must not contradict the mandatory provisions of the Act or of the Articles.

**Policies** are internal guidelines and standards that a co-op uses as a framework to guide the day-to-day activities and decision-making processes of its members, board, employees and volunteers. For Hypha these are contained in our handbook.

**Decision-making** at the AGM:
- We have an official **chair** of the meeting
- Decisions are recorded as **resolutions that are voted** on by members (example language: “Be it resolved that… (BIRT) the bylaws below relating to the transaction of the affairs of (insert name of corporation) be passed.”)
- **Voting** requires enough of us are present to be confident that we have buy-in on decisions (“**quorum**” we are proposing 60% or 5/7 members) 
    - **Each person gets a single vote** only for themselves, you can not vote for someone not present ("serve as a proxy").
    - It will be by **open ballot** (i.e., we all see the results) for general business and, if needed, by **secret ballot** (i.e., only the chair of the meeting will see the results) for board of director positions 
    - Ideally, we will decide discussions and pass resolutions **by consensus**, if not possible, it goes to a vote that has to pass by **a simple majority** (50%+1 of those present, so 4/7,  3/5, 3/4). For particular issues where we cannot reach consensus, some identified in bylaws or ones arising, any member may request (by making a special motion with specific rules) that the resolution be decided by **a majority of two-thirds** (so 5/7, 4/5, 3/4).
    - For 2020 AGM **we will use Loomio to record these decisions**. 
- Depending on the decision, before/after decisions are made by the members, some have to be **adopted by the board of directors** also passing a resolution 

**Governance** is about the oversight, strategic planning, decision-making, and financial planning of an operation.

Different models (ways of framing it so that the parts and processes make sense) to think about governance:
> _Three key things_ that make [co-operative governance] function: “working well together, creating a successful view of the future, and building legitimacy” (from Governance in Co-operatives course prepared by Co-operatives First and Centre for the Study of Co-operatives).

> _Four pillars_ to address gaps and strengthen owner relationships and democratic practices
> - Teaming: successfully working together to achieve common purpose. 
> - Accountable empowerment: success-fully empowering people while at the same time holding them accountable for the power granted.
> - Strategic Leadership: successfully articulating the cooperative’s direction/purpose and setting up the organization for movement in this direction. 
> - Democracy: successfully practising, protecting, promoting, and perpetuating our healthy democracies.

**Management** is about the routine operational decisions and administrative work that makes the operation function.
