# Hypha Goal-setting exercises 2020 Q1

[TOC]

## Step 4 - Present and Agree

* At a final meeting we used a [**spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMFS3IhzZOFQA-yjt7lFcoVO0Ry6erFEH7D1NswvDtA/edit#gid=230139147) to discuss and make minor adjustments

## Step 3 - Define Working Group Goals

* Each working group took the goals below and (re)fashioned them into **OKRs**

### Business Planning

* Build our engagement strategy (eg. brand, web presence, outreach)
* Develop our leads and opportunities pipeline
* Gain a better sense of work that people want to do (what opportunities should we go focus our energies on, gauge interest on different kinds of projects)
    * cross-cut with Infra WG
* Assess our financial sustainability (as “capacity to endure”) by developing key metrics an initial projection
    * cross-cut with Finance WG
* Shorten our lead-to-proposal time (i.e. the time it takes from identifying an opportunity to getting member buy-in in order to submit a proposal)

### Governance

- Write by-laws
    - Draft initial by-laws [Q1]
    - Build to consensus on by-laws
    - Consult a lawyer over by-laws
- Build [governance] relationships with "neighbours"
    - [This is one piece of a larger goal that came out of something in
the Strategic Plan seems mostly BizDev]
    - Defined “Local Solidarity and Decentralized Neighbours”
- Plan initial Annual General Meeting [Q1]
    - Pick date for AGM
    - Set agenda
    - Develop checklist of what is needed from working groups, e.g.,
        - operations "implementation report"
        - year 2 financial plan
    - [stretch] Determine first training/development activity
    - [stretch] Develop peer interviewing protocol
- Host AGM by year-end (June 30, 2020) [Q2]
    - Outcomes:
        - By-laws adopted
        - Upcoming directors/board elected
- Have by-laws and a formal governance structure after AGM [Q2]
- Build organization-wide understanding of governance [Q2]

### From Operations:

- [Ops] Have a set of operating practices around organizational
structure, roles, working groups, etc.

### Finance (proposed)

- develop our financial budget, alignment on how to spend money, and develop projections
- more shared alignment on how to spend money

### Infra (proposed)

- Align/speak from a single voice on values. (there was a point that is now missing below?)

### Org-wide [maybe kick these to operations?]

- feeling like an effective remote organization
- more clarity on shared values around infrastructure
- How do we do more publishing sort of? Have a public voice on the stuff we do
- Sick work that we do and bring and share to each other
- Set deadlines on tasks that relate to our objectives (each WG needs to go through tasks and do this)

### Proposed Metrics

- Define metrics:
    - Are we hitting deadlines
    - Are we hitting financial projections
    - Are individual Members satisfied with their paid and unpaid work
    - Measure team paid:unpaid ratio
    - Measure individual paid:unpaid ratio

## Step 2 - Individual Brainstorming

### patcon

- goals on revenue? client counts? (just seeing a goal of output portfolio after assumed clients)
- feeling wary about spending too much energy on AGM if we don't yet have revenue/clients to celebrate
- O: paid work / KR: # contracts, no matter how small.
- O: more collab with others / KR: # partnerships. closing leads!
- O: being friendly with other agencies / KR: cookies sent to competitors

### dc

- AGM!
- bylaws!
- branding!

Key actions:
- "Develop robust leads and opportunities pipeline" in business plan

    O: "Have new customers and future projects by Q1 end"

    O: "An understanding of our burn rate and financial sustainability projections"
- have this feel less like a grind!
    O: "Feel good about the work that we accomplish and reduce perception of "overhead""
- Meet other co-ops :+1: patcon
    O: "Initate and/or relationships with other co-operatives"
- Partner with another co-op! Q2? :+1: patcon
    O: "Establish a meaningful relationship with other co-operatives"
- Write about ourselves like we're basasses Q2?
    O: "Formally disseminate/publish a summary of ourselves and where we are at!"

### bl

- reflect on financial feasibility and market competitiveness of hypha
    - clockify better metrics
    - are we winning a reasonable amount of deals? are we investing time that lead to our revenue goals?
    - why do we not win some contracts?
- revisit shared practices and process friction points and how to go about iterating on
- revisit policy of partnerships

### About OKR's

(adapted from [Trello blog](https://blog.trello.com/okrs-set-achieve-track-trello) shared by patcon in chat)

**OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.** The Objectives tend to be the desired outcomes that you want, and the Key Results are the measurable ways you know you’re on track to reach them.

An **Objective** helps answer the question, _“Where do I want to go?”_
A **Key Result** helps answer, _“How will I know I’m getting there?”_
