_See the objectives alongside our key results in our [**OKR tracking sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMFS3IhzZOFQA-yjt7lFcoVO0Ry6erFEH7D1NswvDtA/edit)._

## Business Planning

- Build our engagement strategy (eg. brand, web presence, outreach)
- Develop our leads and opportunities pipeline
- Gain a better sense of work that people want to do (what opportunities should we go focus our energies on, gauge interest on different kinds of projects)
    - cross-cut with Infra WG
- Assess our financial sustainability (as “capacity to endure”) by developing key metrics an initial projection
    - cross-cut with Finance WG
- Shorten our lead-to-proposal time (i.e. the time it takes from identifying an opportunity to getting member buy-in in order to submit a proposal)

## Finance

- develop our financial budget, alignment on how to spend money, and develop projections
- more shared alignment on how to spend money

## Governance

- Write by-laws
    - Draft initial by-laws [Q1]
    - Build to consensus on by-laws
    - Consult a lawyer over by-laws
- Build [governance] relationships with "neighbours"
    - [This is one piece of a larger goal that came out of something in
the Strategic Plan seems mostly BizDev]
    - Defined “Local Solidarity and Decentralized Neighbours”
- Plan initial Annual General Meeting [Q1]
    - Pick date for AGM
    - Set agenda
    - Develop checklist of what is needed from working groups, e.g.,

## Operations

- [Ops] Have a set of operating practices around organizational
structure, roles, working groups, etc.


## Infrastructire

- Align/speak from a single voice on values. (there was a point that is now missing below?)

## Org-wide [maybe kick these to operations?]

- Feeling like an effective remote organization
- More clarity on shared values around infrastructure
- How do we do more publishing sort of? Have a public voice on the stuff we do
- Sick work that we do and bring and share to each other
- Set deadlines on tasks that relate to our objectives (each WG needs to go through tasks and do this)

## Proposed Metrics

- Are we hitting financial projections
- Are individual Members satisfied with their paid and unpaid work
- Measure team paid:unpaid ratio
- Measure individual paid:unpaid ratio
