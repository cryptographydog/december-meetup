## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- dc: miro session
- pc: call wtih FACTIC peeps
- the wizardry of command line skills

### Announcements

- tech soup membership. needs article of incorp with proper NPO objects.
    - dc: some tension around things not yet needed and cart before horse
    - pc: no cost ... preference for advocating a right to some "messiness".
    - tension not resolved, but not urgent to do so. future middle ground...?

### Discussions

- StART admin
    - value based billing
        - NL wants hours to go away (to not think about tracking them)
    - pc: Hypha has willingness for admin to take cut.
    - c4c ok with double invoice
    - hypha can still invoice hours to NL. Hypha can still track hours.
    - dc: 30% admin overhead = normal to low. in Hypha discussions, sense that it should be higher than internal 25% clip. 
        - 100% match in common for some contracting relationships
        - luisa interested to speak with bl re: finance process
            - dc also willing, re: admin rates
- Articles of Amendment :((
    - wendy rejected for not containing text. but we took example from fed.
    - wendy knew this the whole time.
    - #todo:dc new resolution new submission. share sigs, no PGP keys. bl+yj sign. +1 pc
        - #todo:dc director meeting announce 24h notice next week. only 3 for quorum.
        - PROTIP 35 biz days turnaround for co-op.
- Open Collective
    - Threads:
        - Onboarding
            - Templating
            - #todo pc: Actual onboarding (not blocked)
        - Pitch for OC Canada
            - following initiative template
            - https://hackmd.io/Kooq3QUcR0CJ2r83OHhemQ?view
        - Wrap up "refining" GH issue, https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/374
            - Plain language
            - minimal viable support docs :)
        - Next steps aka get from soft launch to LAUNCH
            - dc: suggests 6 mo. fall? sept?
            - pc: might realize Hypha initiative folds into OC Canada. dc: maybe Hypha offering becomes "artisanal".
            - dc: bl was eager to support [canadian] dweb projects
            - dc: all risk tolerance. maybe favour smaller project with high trust in BC, vs large unknown groups in Toronto. "good neighbors" anywhere.
        - pc: was imagining first-come-first-serve, but not good idea.
        - "Saying no" (reasons)
            - bad vibes
            - capacity
                - financial (finance group)
                - admin (initiative+ops groups)
        - Our guidelines
            - v1: up to 6 collectives. re-evaluate after 6 months. (6 incl existing) 666
                - x months: aligned with? (1) ctto return to physical, (2) OC Canada timelines [emergent]
                - committment is FISCAL HOCAL HOST IN NARROW SENSE
                - have calls/pool to gauge future opportunities
                - software licenses / hardware = liability
                    - **warranty
            - v2: up to X collectives--wanting room to bring on more
                - thinking about for now
        - Advertising strategy? 
            - ~6 
            - maybe more stale leads from OC (they are going back thru old requests)
            - don't overcommit (so we don't encourage ppl to cycle on us)
    - #todo draft initiative? https://hackmd.io/Kooq3QUcR0CJ2r83OHhemQ?view
        - v1 of our offering of OC
            - adverstising OC
            - onboarding
            - operations
        - understanding relationship of Hypha to OC Canada
    - At what stage would extended offerings happen?
        - a careful check-in on other needs without conferring that we are ALREADY DOING THEM
