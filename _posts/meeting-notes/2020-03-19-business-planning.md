## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- Testing Big Blue Button
    - change default presentation
        - can't upload large files
    - can we turn off the "you are now muted" voice each time we mute and unmute
        - pc: kinda like that personally (incl #a11y)
    - where do notes live?
    - shared notes OR chat, not both
    - mic isolation?
        - seems decent! but still can pick up env. sounds (e.g. keyboards)
    - presentation uploading
        - "File is too large. Please split into multiple files." > 1mb
    - annotation feature is smooth ("like ice")
    - closed captioning is manual, can be user-toggled for display, one moderator at a time (can take over) and can be exported as text file
    - echo test happens every breakout, very annoying
