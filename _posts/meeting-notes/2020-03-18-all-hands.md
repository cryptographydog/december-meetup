### Discussions

- Sign-off on dc's [dissertation research partnership](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/issues/31)
    - **DECISION**: approval from all (all member-owners present)
    - #todo:bl sign document on behalf of org
    - dc: was some questions on how to align outcomes.
        - #todo:dc discuss in future session
    - uv: question: out of scope session. is that something that can be worked on in ongoing basis? since don't know future clients. dc: can revise agreement at any time.
        - dc: if there's a consistent area ppl keep requesting is off-the-record, then can "promote" that to a revision
        - #todo:bl+dc: add clause that "either party can request amendment at any time"
- Discuss [COVID-19 response](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/229)
    - Internally: Hypha-to-Members
        - dc: came up in operations. attended webinar on co-op response. upcoming on worker co-op specifically.
            - opinion: need to have a policy. not urgent due to remote nature.
            - but helpful to understand priorities as business. employee safety, community safety, business/operating continuity. surfacing risks.
            - identify needed supports, particularly for primary income folks
            - better understanding of financial reserves
            - today: **priorities, risks and needed supports**
            - think on multi-month scale of disruption
            - bl: are we enabling behaviors by accepting some client conditions
        - bl: clips + reserves
            - shared https://link.hypha.coop/projections
            - 11% of billed amount goes to co-op from 25% clip
            - ~CAD$1690 in bank (not deep reserves)
        - are there worker needs/supports?
            - dc: package announced today. business income supports.
                - https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2020/03/canadas-covid-19-economic-response-plan-support-for-canadians-and-businesses.html
                - would it be helpful to get info via Hypha?
                    - #todo Hypha navigate/digest this info
            - uv: like the idea of hypha being the place where we get information.
                - including related to new deadline for personal taxes. share the burden of finding out that info.
                - dc: would become the work of operations
                    - #todo: operations to draft policy
        - risks?
            - uv: business continuity. what if a number of unavailable for whatever reason?
            - can we pause for 1/2 mths
            - uv: concerned with business continuity risks. what if a number of us disappear for a period of time? Are we in a position where we could go on pause for a number of months?
                - bl: org, or project? uv: both
                    - uv: not concerned with existing client, directly
        - priorities?
            - bl: member safety/comfort; org public role; individual client relations/loss of business
                - bl: do we turn down or hard-no certain opportunities
                    - dc: union-speak: "right to refuse unsafe work"
                    - bl: "unsafe" might have community consequences, not just worker safety
                    - can hypha tell someone "no don't take this opportunity as hypha"
                    - yj: as directors, what are our responsibilities to employees
                    - bl: not simple, as our work can enable unsafe community activity
                    - may be harming short-term financial health of members and org
                    - uv: +1 for granting Hypha the ability to block member activities if they are considered unsafe for either members or the community at large, but tightly scoped to COVID-19 (+1 el, dc, bl, pc)
    - Externally: Hypha-to-World
        - [WIP pad](https://hackmd.io/D_EFCPkpTeKyAuYJ_C-3Cw?view)
        - bl: goals?
          - bl wrote: https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/229#issuecomment-600351763
          - uv: not ready to state beyond what's in doc
          - dc: mutual aid support for ppl > businesses
              - COVID response doesn't do enough to individuals
                  - does direct giving, but not enough
          - pc: eager to help people with casual/informal supports (how to hang out), as feel intertwined with work health
          - pc: existing projects are ramping up and many need support. what would a hypha "soup-kitchen day" feel like?
        - next steps:
          - elon and garry and ben will work on website
          - scheduled next 3 meetings
          - is BBB ready for use?
              - https://bbb.hypha.coop
          - dc: would love to use BBB internally. academics saying nice things about breakout room modules
          - bl: proposal, using it for next bizdev meeting? +1 uv
              - el: can do.
              - #todo:el remove signup restrictions from bbb
- AGM in the time of COVID-19
    - Options
        1. business-as-usual: wait. make go-no-go decision May 15. fallback plan if needed
        2. postpone AGM: can wait up to 18mo
        3. go full remote. figure out how to do social thing.
            - concern of effectiveness
            - maybe should be in person for first to approve bylaws
        4. hybrid. (directors in person?)
            - risk: ppl have relationships with high-risk ppl
- "business as usual" but select plan B: postpone slightly if situation allows / "full remote"
- **DECISION**:
  - May 15 to decide go/no go for in-person
  - second option: shift to june
  - third option: full remote
    - risk: may have to redo some things (presumed low)
        - pc: remote doesn't seem as bad in this moment as it normally would?
        - bl: some of our risks are comms risks. might continue to not be resolved over chat.
        - dc: if doing remote, would need to commit to higher amount of participation than how we run other sessions
        - uv: might be neat to try alternatives like games
        - pc/gi: MINECRAFT IS SIIIICK
        - el: in person more valuable
        - bl: anyone have sense of how they might feel about meeting in person later?
    - uv: ben still in town in May? life in flux, but can travel back.
