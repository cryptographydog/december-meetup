	- #185 reimbursement
	    - just need to pay it
	    - dc still needs to file
	    - notified everyone except pc
	    - bl unsure about pre-incorporation expenses
	        - yj: can do as regular expense < $50,000
            - in QB count it as a incorporation date expense
    - #155 org summary. bl will do it

    - #261 covid-19 financial support. yj to call
    - bl will take care of payroll for May, and we will assign Finance roles end-May

### Discussions

- update OKRs
    - [a bunch of KRs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMFS3IhzZOFQA-yjt7lFcoVO0Ry6erFEH7D1NswvDtA/edit#gid=777136342) are done!
    - "Devise strategy to secure support funding and credit for business to cope with uncertainties"
        - bl: need to talk to Desjardins about credit availability
        - bl: possibility of member loans in cases of emergency
        - #todo call Desjardins and inquire about BCAP + other credit availability based on our situation
    - "Capture evaluation of our capacity to support members and neighbours"
        - yj: covid19.hypha.coop as neighbour support
        - bl: finance communicated that we can donate < $100 amount
- #todo how much $ can members pool in as an "emergency credit access"
    - poll members about restrictions on this money
        1. if Hypha cannot pay our bills
        2. if a member has a personal emergency
    - this should check off most of the above two KRs

### Process Checkout

- we're in good shape!
