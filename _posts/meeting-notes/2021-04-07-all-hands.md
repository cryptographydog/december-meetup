    - gi: need a little more info on what systems ppl are using
    - gi: some issues tagged for caldav and activesync as possible solutions
        - in the gh issue
    - pc: having infra be bookable? 1:1 to resolve?
    - dc: i think it's ok for infra to be like "this is the sanctioned combo"
    - yj: hard to know what works these days. open protocols don't work well.
    - dc: would be nice if infra could follow up with people
