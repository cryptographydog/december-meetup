## Discussions

- IRP (pc)
    - + feedback
    - 200 amplications 23 where funded
    - seem to misunderstand the goal
    - Ours - interest, +1 on partners, interesting angle, support groups that support target communities
    - Left some things out (bylaws etc)
    - Added some operating cost 1st round where 0 2nd round adjusted to allow
    - Suggestion for budget - connect budget item to what it supports
    - Warn of use of "insider" languange like "low fedelity prototype"
    - If we resubmit - You need to connect it to the next step of future funding (clearly point to how money is comming in)
    - Just do some sort of survey, validate your assumptions/experiences
    - bl: how do we (hypha) get paid is unclear
    - pc: 20% can go to ops cost which can go to hypha. 
    - opened today, dont know close date but (probably October)
