#### OKRs & Strategic Plan for Operations

- Goal 3: Hypha should build on our financial budgeting and tracking strategies (Fin, Ops)
    - bl: time-tracking important, categorize
    - bl: may feed into contibution accounting
    - "internal" labour associated with projects (ops+finance, e.g., hiring, invoicing, payroll, bizdev)
        - e.g., "set up time" per-project
        - how is infra implicated on this?
        - vs. organizational labour associated with Hypha operations
    - key actions:
        - Develop internal guideline to get a sense of how much cost for each project
        - Update clockify policy for members to develop better tracking/understanding of internal hours
    - want costs of labour:
        - how much to: set up lead, set up project, ongoing project costs, keep the organization going
    - KR(ish): Update and document tags and tasks in clockify and update guide for members
    - KR: 
        - need more!
- Goal 5: Hypha should identify and support members setting learning goals and interests (Ops)
    - KR: draft of good member doc for review (e.g. take up notes from AGM... these are more "internal facing and collaboration" skills as opposed to technical/area/discipline competencies)
    - KR: develop a map of skill gaps across organization (organizational core competencies) in Loomio
        - (from action around identify skill gaps)
        - "these are the skills I have and these are the skills I want to have"
        - "what skills do you think I am missing?"
    - KR: Updated peer feedback process for Q3 check-in
    - KR: Held X calls around competency gaps with folks in industry
- Goal 7: Hypha should develop our workflow and processes to support a culture of accountability with defined collaboration and decision-making techniques and tools (Inf, Ops)
    - KR: "agreement" on needs for decision-making pain points
    - KR: document decision-making boundaries for each WG in handbook
        - When can you act individually and report back (to WG or all hands)
            - "in this situation who are you accountable to first?" org, wg, individual?
        - When can WGs take lead on financial dec'ns without all member consensus
        - How do we shorten the proposal-to-dec'n loop
- Goal 8: Hypha should takes steps to ensure our values are reflected in key strategic and financial decisions: procurement, establishing partnerships, and hiring (Fin, Ops)
    - KR: document hiring policy
    - KR: develop neighbour language around solidarity pricing program
    - KR: hold a post-mortem on server procurement process to inform future procurements
    - KR: draft a template for procurement in Guides based on existing one
        - some decisions need much shorter proposals to reach dec'ns... e.g. cost/expense, procurement....
- Objective missing for operations / gov
- Cleanup for stuff from Q1/Q2 spillover
