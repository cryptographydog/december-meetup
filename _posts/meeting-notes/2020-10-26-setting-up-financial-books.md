Location:   https://link.hypha.coop/calls  
Attending:  bl, hema, rodica  

## Agenda

1. Open Collective trust account
2. Grants (e.g. GFTW) and projects on retainer
3. Reserve funds and accounts

## Notes

### Open Collective trust account

- OC is a liability account
    - when amounts reach about 10k we should set up a separate bank (savings) account bc we are holding money that don't belong to us
    - for now, we can manage this through QB accounts
- In QB, no class, no subaccount
    - Credit and debit a OC account under Chart of Accounts as transactions come in
- Use memo line to indicate "for who"
- Are vendors "Hypha vendors" or not?
    - when a vendor invoices an OC Collective, are they a Hypha vendor in QB?
        - for now, no, try this for a quarter
        - this means we don't keep OC invoices in QB
        - finances don't get mixed into our accounts payable
        - invoices are not "Hypha vendors", but those of the Collectives

### Grants (e.g. GFTW) and projects on retainer

- grant vs. retainer?
    - retainer is not income (unearned money), but a grant is (earned money) even if work has not been carried out
- can use _Class_ to show in income statement, but we decided to use _Projects_
- how much of wages went to grant?
    - change payroll to per person per project (in Wagepoint syncs)
- when to use Class vs. Projects?
    - Class
        - for internal projects, year-over-year ledgers
        - more versatile, multiple income sources
        - line-item level association
    - Projects
        - durational one-off projects, tied to single client
        - tied to single client per project
        - per-invoice level association

### Reserve funds and accounts

- technical term is _internally restricted account_
- allocation by board decision
- ben to create reserve account as subaccount of _Chequing_ under Chart of Accounts
- report expenses into a "Reserve Funds" class, so it shows up in P/L
