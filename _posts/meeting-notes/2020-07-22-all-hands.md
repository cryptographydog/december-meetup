## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- Losing power stories...?
    - uv: when I was 8 I stuck a knife and then my finger into a power socket, took down power for the block
    - el: I don't have any, perfect servers
    - dc: missed the intense outages in Toronto, when young they were rationing power at 4 in the morning , 12+ hours a day without power
    - bl: remember power back up units, keep beeping, more annoying than the actual power outage. more recent episode in greece, brown outs, more concerned about heat
    - yj: on the road, lost power a few weeks ago, ignore ups beeping but was in the middle of a conference call. lots of redundancies -- apc batteries, turn off battery but turn on surge function
