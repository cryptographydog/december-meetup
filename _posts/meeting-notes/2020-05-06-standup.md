## Discussions

- Email Show and Tell 
    - Gist: how to change your password, send-as, forward, alias, who's on which list, get onto a new group address
    - Doc: https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/blob/master/documents/infrastructure/email.md
    - Shortlink: https://link.hypha.coop/email
- Postponing AGM until June, switching to virtual format (shorter), check-in on weekend dates:
    - 6-7
    - **13-14** <-- Gov WG proposes this
    - 20-21 
        - uv: prefer 1 day on weekend, 12-15 maybe booked
        - bl: tiring for 1 day, with little gap
        - yj: nothing scheduled, open 
        - gi: open
        - el: open
        - bl: 13-14 works
        - dc: same
    - dc: polling for all
    - request: each WG is expected to present a "formal" report (2-5 hours of work from start-June)
- Check-in on WG capacity
    - bl: how we can decide on org pacing, how people feel on progress, talked briefly in ops
    - uv: moving at a unsustainable pace?
        - bl: not moving fast on org goals, personal level: not sustainable
        - bl: unexpect commitments adding up
        - yj: inverted from bl (ft commitments)
        - uv: similar to yj, lots of commitments, feels temporary, flatten out over time
        - dc: a lot of authority over commitments, more time on hypha things, COVID-19 related, timing is unfortunate, might be moving at a faster pace than what we can manage
        - uv: thoughts on work being done differently?
            - bl: resolve internal processes, load-balancing, prioritizing challenges in WGs. maybe more async work?
            - bl: actively doing check-ins (room), more org-wide comms outside of sync meetings
            - dc: looking at basecamp as a model (think time, no chat), daily stand-ups maybe, examples we could look
            - dc: getting better at time in meetings. maybe 1 hour of sync time per-week
        - next steps: can we imagine a model that defocuses on chat, more attention on async platforms?
        - dc: end meetings on time, cut meetings off if it goes over
- #todo: end meetings on time
- #todo: leverage github over chat for discussion
