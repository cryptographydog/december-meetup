        - We can shut down temporarily if needed
        - We can offer ROE
- yj: pretty well documented where things reside, credentials all in passbolt
    - couple points that don't pass "bus scenario", e.g. bbb and jitsi, but those aren't critical
    - email & website is with el, possible risk there
    - tomesh chat on justin's server
- bl: finance, bl and yj both know everything about finance but if we are both out it may be a problem

### COVID-19 external response

- uv: resource on our site
    - how to support mutual aid groups
    - found no existing resource
    - [Common Knowledge](https://commonknowledge.coop) out of UK that match digital technologists with mutual aid groups
        - simple techology like spreadsheets, websites, google forms
