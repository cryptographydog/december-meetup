### Discussions

- HST status https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/120
    - bl: our **small biz limit** should be $50,000
    - bl: **tax exempt** vs. **zero-rated**
        - Aether is zero-rated bc export
        - a "mission project" is tax exempt
    - bl: **ITCs**
        - bl: for HST tax exempt stuff we cannot claim ITC
            - yj: we buy two boxes of cables, can write off HST, use one box for a mission project (doesn't get charge HST)
                - bl: idk...
                - yj: what about "internal operational purchases"
        - bl: for HST zero-rated stuff, we can claim ITC
            - e.g. ITC for Aether
    - yj: contractor charges HST and gives to government, we pay that HST and government gives to us, so only person at the end pays HST once (not every step along the chain)
    - bl: if we get a $2,000 grant to do mission work (tax-exempt), we hire a company for $1,000 to do half the work, they bill us $1,000 + $130 HST, we cannot claim the $130 as ITC (it needs to come out of the grant money)
    - yj: we have to make sure we budget properly by taking HST out of the grant
    - bl: ask Hema about **Simplified method for claiming ITCs** and **special quick method** (which avoids having to claim ITCs altogether)
