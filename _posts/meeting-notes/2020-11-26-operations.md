## Notes

### Task Board Review

- _skipped_

### Discussions

- Discussion about Open Collective Fiscal Agreement (with bl)
    - https://handbook.hypha.coop/fiscal-sponsorship.html
    - gut-check: feel good someone looked at us and gave feedback
    - "intended services/roles of the different personas, and what separates them"
    - bl: inconsistencies between legal and ben looking at it
        - model A/B
        - alana: is this income to coop?
    - context
        - first person with legal perspective reviewing. USA or Canada? Not clear. #ask
        - Sean _______
    - Each part (4)
        - 1. "silent on workflow", but dc: platform contains the workflow. Do we need to define here?
        - 2. bl: does membership have ability to make this decision without board?
            - we said it should be "all members" in bylaws, re: entering into contract.
            - Section 8. treats all members in WGs as "Managers"
            - Our interpretation:
                - Correct balance of Board oversight v. Operations (e.g. board approve collectives), or full Operations (WG has full authority)?
                - We don't think they are collective members are employees because they don't meet the definition and determine their own activities
            - TRUST ACCT versus OUR INCOME
                - trust acct makes you a payment processor (TransferWise then won't deal with us, see: Platform 6 situation)
                - we classify this as Our Income
            - dc: we're maybe overloading "fiscal sponsorship" an established term that's used for orgs that help groups enter into leases, hire, etc.
        - 3. IP
            - needs more clarification, we think this might be a mismatch of expectations and workstyles. Don't see this as a concern
        - 4. Things we offer / we are responsible for:
            - "what levels of compliance, security, international reach, etc. can a participant expect of Hypha's services/fiscal sponsorship (other than its incorporation in Toronto)?"
              - Things NOT included: Insurance, 
            - We would like some intangible soft benefits but not able to define at this stage
            - #todo draft sentence for intro of fiscal page 
    - next steps:
        - Set up this call with Sean -- Is Sean coming to tomorrow meeting?
        - #todo draft sentence for intro of fiscal page about 4
        - circle back after info sesh
- Holiday hours
    - Lite tracking :lock:
    - Operations proposal:
        - Sat, Dec 19, 2020 - Jan 3, 2021 
        - Jan 4 - 10, 2021 NO INTERNAL CALLS?  
        - Propose the 3 weeks, individually people able to be "back" after Jan 4 (maybe we want someone to monitor email that week and respond) BUT plan for internal WG business to resume Jan 11, 2021.
- Holiday party planning
    - Sun, Dec 13 4-6:30pm ET [UTC-05]
    - Among Us. Invite collaborators + clients.
    - #todo cowork on this next Ops call
        - create a yulelog background screen.
        - create door graphics for each "room"
        - cheesy clipart invite for "Holidy Drop-In Party"
        - Miro board?
        - bbb = bad for this. Jitsi instead.
    - 2.5h; 1h "drop in" and then among us playtime
    - multi-breakouts
    - inspo: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-run-a-zoom-cocktail-party-and-have-better-classes-conferences-and-meetings-too-dc2c5b58f8be
