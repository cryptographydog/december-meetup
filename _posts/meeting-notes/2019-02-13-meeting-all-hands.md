## Notes

### PL Debrief

- Recent call with Evan
    - outcome was unexpected
    - stated OKRs not seen as priority
    - Concerns about amount (both $ and work scope)
    - Questions about overhead for managing/administrating a grant of this magnitude
    - Concern with who had project management experience
    - Tacking on launch of cooperative; additional work?
    - If narrower scope of work would only require one team to evaluate, so simpler
- Ask for more rigorous process
- dc: Let's think on big vs micro grants
- Future opportunities:
    - nothing firm, but seems yes?
    - smaller
    - touches on one team (unclear on budget)
- Reflect on how to speak about big ideas in smaller ways
- There are many grant opportunities but we need to decide how much we want to fit ourselves to be ready for those opportunities

### Quick Working Group Updates

- Finance
    - Talked to DUCA Credit Union
    - dc: see others as alternatives? desjardins?
    - ~~People~~ Ben doesn't seem to like Alterna
        - Dawn banks with them personally, Our Networks is there too. DC: I think it is totally fine. patcon: me too.
    - dc: In research, good to 1) do more than two, and 2) hit a spectrum.
    - Desjardin = huge size :+1:
    - Next steps:
        - Call Meridian and Desjardin :star:
        - More research with SMB person at DUCA & Toronto branch :star:
- Governance
    - Conversations with OCA Peter, Forth Pig about not-for-profit v. "regular" governance structure (dc, patcon, ben)
    - OCA webinar: incremental is good. Set a long timeline (patcon)

- Infra and Ops
    - Conversation around backups
    - Agreed to take up milestones
    - Conversation on scale (this is the x-over between business planning/ops/infra)
