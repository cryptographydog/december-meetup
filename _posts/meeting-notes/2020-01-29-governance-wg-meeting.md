            - what's in scope of bylaws?
            - dc: story of student union: template bylaws and added extra. operating book had bylaw-y comments. split was all off.
            - dc: plain language
            - pc: would love to read "bad bylaws" to develop stronger sense

### Co-work: Working Group Milestones into Objectives and Road to AGM 

From Udit, January Cultivator: 
> "Could we have each working group spend time with their section below to discuss internally and flesh them out. And in our next All Hands (Wed, Feb 5th) each working group will present all the (1) objectives they wish to pursue for the year and (2) milestones that need to be hit/indicators that demonstrate success."

Process:
- check-in on **O** language
- write/convert existing bullets into **KRs**
- confirm timing, add [Q1], [Q2]

Revised Governance objectives:
- **O**: Formalize a governance structure that meets legal requirements [Q2]
    - **KR:** By-laws drafted [Q1]
    - **KR:** Consult professionals (legal & accounting) over by-laws [Q2]
    - **KR:** Publicly share annotated/plain language version of our bylaws [Q3]
- **O**: Build [governance] relationships with "neighbours" [Q2]  
    _This is piece of a larger goal in the Strategic Plan connected to BizDev_
    - **KR:** Develop working definition of "Local Solidarity" and "Decentralized Neighbours" [Q1]
    - **KR:** Materially celebrate a peer or neighbouring organization publically [Q1]

- **O**: Build organization-wide understanding of governance [Q2]
    - **KR**: Develop distinct responsibilities for governance and operations working groups [Q1]
    - **KR**: Demonstrate improved individual understanding of concepts through AGM participation. [Q2]

    - **KR**: Identify operating practices around organizational structure, roles, and working groups [Q2]
    - **KR**: Map existing tasks to roles [Q2]
    - **KR**: Run 1 experiment to map organizational sentiments

Additional Operations goals (from All Hands):
- **O**: Cultivate the culture needed to be an effective remote organization
- **O**: Develop a public voice for the work we do [related to above objective: Build [governance] relationships with “neighbours”]
    - **KR**s from above could move down
- Feel empowered to do sick work and share it with each other 
    - [feels like personal objective? related to effective remote organization objective. Not sure how to plan this Q1]
