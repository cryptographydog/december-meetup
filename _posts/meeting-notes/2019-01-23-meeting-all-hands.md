    - Finance
        - Notes from visit to DUCA: https://hackmd.io/JCKRSvcTQ12EP-O_nzd-mQ?edit
        - Things more difficult with multi-sig
        - Some question over wires that Yurko wants to confirm
        - patcon: ability to waive fees?
        - patcon: is there a way to think about non-multisig
            - e.g. expenses versus paying from bank account
        -dawn: Keep small cash pool for day-to-day with shared password to avoid multi-sig burden on everything (e.g. OpenCollective, PayPal, recurring costs not paid out of pocket by members), but also understand the cases we want multisig (paying out major expenses?)
    - Infra and Ops
        - Laundry list of tools, potentially out of scope? Needs versus project "wants"?
        - benhylau: make tools on as-needed basis
        - yurko: prioritize password management (benhylau +1)
            - thinking about project and task management
            - knowledge management
        - Milestones for this group needs to be clarified, this should move forward!
        - Infrastructure as code
            - dcwalk: over-automating infra may be harmful to the org (e.g., 100% reproducible deployment vs. exceptions)
            - dcwalk: let's not die on the infra hill...?
