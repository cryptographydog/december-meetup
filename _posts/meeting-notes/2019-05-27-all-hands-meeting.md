    - Wed 1-5:30 pm in-person wg session: ben, dcwalk, patcon (remote)
        - evening: garry, udit, patcon (?remote)
    - ben: how do we get input on biz plan re: questions that need broader consultation
        - loomio and google doc comments
- [Finance][fin-wg]
    - no updates

    - Fourth Pig interview (see notes)

    - follow-ups: grants (Reba), accountant, wave accounting
- [Infra & Ops][ino-wg]
    - started moving pass to .coop
    - looked into vision board thing

### Business Plan Discussions 

#### 1. General reflections

- Test assumptions through first project
- Things about compensation will probably get a lot of changes
- Financial projection for Y1 (what is the worst possible?) we need that, and cost of dissolution

#### 2. Competitive positioning and Offerings 

- [Activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8C1XZcDpu1r4ciecbKEZ6vOL41nTinfqPCbZDhkAWc/edit?ts=5ceac2f3#heading=h.ndof266taab4)
    - Metrics for how we position ourselves: market/mission-driven; design/development
    - Are the axes appropriate? 
        - gi: implementation / strategy more helpful than current
- Check-in on offerings (quick!)
    - Question of whether "infrastructure management" should be included
        - doing infra stuff in the first year difficult (so many unknowns) 
    - Offerings look good to everyone broadly
    - Perhaps takeaway is that we need to think about ongoing support
    - Is this more of an ongoing relationship
    - **Agreed: We will _not_ do infra management model as initial project**
    
#### 3. Sweat Equity

- how does this equity accrue and how is tracked? 
        - DC: We agreed at an all hands to track our own hours in the coop, are people doing this?
            - seems like only dawn and patcon
        - difficulty for some folks in tracking hours
- is there a compensation scheme in place for sweat equity when funds are available in the future?
        - DC: Fourth Pig example for handling this: initial committment to pay for it, first surplus (years later), looked at all hours, one member made proposal for amount to repay (wound up as pennies on the dollar of current hourly rate) that all consensed with.
- alternatives to tracking hours? (more particularly for sweat equity?)
    - gi: adament about tracking per-project hours
    - y: two approaches: time-/project- v. salaried (calc some percentage). difficult to time-based tracking: hard to task switch
    - b: time percentage based on participating in working group? budget for time, specific tasks
    - u: seems like time remains the underlying metric
- maybe the point, tracking at a level of specificity to help understand activities (e.g., figuring out roles and rates)
- what time:
    - general time 
    - project time (dc: strongly thinks this should be kept seperate at first )
- track generally to hourly precision

**Consensed: all present agreed to the following sweat equity approach**:
- goal: future compensation consensed upon at a later date
- track sweat equity during setup to an hourly level precision
- personally track (no shared tool)
- best judgement about hours spent back to the beginning (Augustish 2018)
- continue until superseded by an agreed upon compensation structure

## Agenda 

- Discussion: **Review business plan and Y1 strategic/financial plan.** Key points:

    5. Projects: Pricing and Leads

## Notes

#### 4. Membership

- Member classes
- Member fees
    - [name=patcon] money vs time for buy-in
        - :heart: no desire to block on one-time or recurring fees, but only understanding it as means to create buy-in/ownership (initially), and healthy membership atrophy (recurring).
        - :heart: interested in finding other ways to guage/build the above things in long term. others seeem to agree.
        - :heart: Feel there are other, more aligned metrics to do that.
        - :heart: Feel inclined to set 0$ for all fees, and lean on some other metric.
        - Curious about using **time** as both buy-in metric, and yearly membership check-in.
        - :heart: Unsure if min % or static hours is best.
        - :mag: Time-tracking is category-specific, and knows "internal" vs "client-billable"
        - :heart: I feel our membership entry/renewal metric could be time-centric and category-specific.
        - Encourages time-tracking from the first stages of membership convos.
        - :mag: Mature and failed co-ops flagged time-tracking as very important step in growth.
        - :heart: building this capacity as part of member onboarding feels significant: "we don't want your money, but we want commitments to be legible to one another"
        - :mag: Traditional co-ops might not have a way to participate in internals before memberizing.
        - :mag: Our open source work and open resources mean that folks can contribute time before memberizing or even contracting.
        - :heart: Disclosure: I am prone to anti-patterns through overestimation of others' and underestimation of my own time commitments. But there are more systemic perks we've heard from other orgs.
- Relationship between employee and member, founding members
    - DC: From Fourth Pig, this can be more straightforward than thought. Recommend ALL sign articles of incorporation b/c benefits without obligations, but just the subset who indicated interest sign on as Directors of the Board.

- **Consensed on single class of membership**

- **Approved with no blocks** a $0 membership fee

- **Approved proposal for all involved to sign as a Founding Member but not as Initial Directors** (unless they want to) 

#### 5. Projects: Pricing and Leads 

- Leads and opportunities
- Project pricing
- Discuss alongside "first project" examples: Aether; ~~Fee-for-service Cloud~~; Consulting (Patcon's); Udit

Start with three pitches:

1. Aether (general sense of fit)
  - hourly rate are we okay with it?
  - some capcity, we are on the learning side (understood and okay with that)
2. Patcon's: Consult (less, but sense that it fits)
  - consultation; maybe moves into implementation (unclear)
  - Is it okay if projects are individual?
  - Prioritizing repeat and ongoing leads
  - timeline: immediate, lead generation
  - budget: unknown
3. Udit's (less clear but sense)
  - (unprepared)
  - lead through other employer involved in much larger set of strategy and development
      - sub outcomes: technologies they want to build: website; design deliverables
  - coop as vendor 
  - timeline: project mid-2020; implementation late-2020
  - budget: unknown (bit potential range)

Opening to discussion:

- Member involvement (stronger?)
  - *no issue or hard no with people running individual projects through the co-op*
  - build a texture/develop shape for involvement of multiple members important for now
- Are there things people don't want to work on?
  - e.g.: dc "no military contractors"
  - Develop a priority matrix as part of our strategic 
- #todo Leads (over time):
  - develop pitch template 
  - portfolio/bios
  - initial phase priority matrix
  - next step on Aether Pitch: async develpo project back
- Project Pricing
  - Hourly? Project rates?
- Reduction/discount for "neighbours"
- Retainer model (up to hours _or_ above # at a rate)
- Clear deliverables and scope (project management!!)
- Our internal calculations?
  - hourly
  - not seperate per role/hourly rate
  - but some "roles" e.g., admin, copywriting
  - (do we reveal an hourly rate that we bill out?)
- In lead discussions: we need to be armed with some "quick math": 
  - one-pager near term important
  - udit: bottom-up (hours); top-down (client; spend;)
- #todo Pricing next steps:
  - collect/share some examples 
  - task/rate sheet midterm goal
  - pricing math

#### 6. Compensation

- Relationship of "billable" and "non-billable" work and compensation
- Wage (Living Wage, Guaranteed Income)
- Preliminary discussion but needs more, in concert with project

#### 7. Financal Plan

- Y1 operating costs
- Projected income (profit-loss) statement
- Skipped due to lack of time

#### 8. Strategic Plan (lite)

- Skipped in interest of time

#### 9. Review/walkthrough Articles of Incorporation

- Had a ceremonial signing, photographed!
