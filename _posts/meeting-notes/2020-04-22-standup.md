### Coronavirus Zone ðŸ¦ 

- CERB eligibility
    - BL: Personal application, made eligibility requirement changes. If you were paid more than $5000 last year and less than 1000 in a 14-day period within one of the CERB 4-week periods this year. It's very easy. As an employer, finance team can provide info on how much you earned.

    - gi: second half of month (after yj)
    - dc: available to help yj and gi if needed as previous cultivator
        - #todo dc: to add to small tasks
- Struggling with Jitsi, could we switch to BBB?
    - uv: struggling esp with hackmd open (if both open, one of them starts failing)
    - uv: can we switch to BBB
    - dc: also for meeeeee, thinks it's a memory leak with firefox
    - uv: with chrome too
    - yj: intermittent problems with jitsi, connection is weird, other ppl have reported this problem too
        - infra is investigating with a packet capture now
    - bl: supportive of BBB, moved half my calls to it, experience has been much better
    - dc: other ppl, on our jitsi?
        - gi: significant A/V lag
        - uv: me too, lag
    - dc: next all hands we switch to BBB
        - jitsi native mobile app is really good
        - bl: also no call-in number
- Payroll period adjustment
    - bl: current pay period wrong (April pay period, April 15 pay date)
        - but, work done in March
        - there is a mismatch
    - moving forward:
        - pay period shifted to match actual hours worked
        - pay date in arrears in middle of subsequent month
        - dc: preference for monthly paycheque still, not eligible for CERB
        - uv: not effected RE:CERB, no strong preference
    - bl:
        - **pay day May 15** will cover **pay period May 1-15**, and will cover client work thru **April 1-30**
        - **pay day June 15** will cover **pay period May 16-31**, and will cover client work thru **May 1-31**
