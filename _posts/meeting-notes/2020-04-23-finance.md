## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- Jitsi, how are you doing?
    - yj: load used to be between 6-7, only had 6 cores, seems some things are getting delayed... now our load average is 0.1 of 1 core
    - switched to a whole new computer altogether
    - old machine
        - 8 cores, gave 6 to jitsi, machine also has other stuff running, uses Proxmox/KVM
        - 2.3 GHz (2018 Q1 processor)
    - new machine
        - 12 cores, gave 8 to jitsi, machine has nothing else running (except shared storage), uses VMware vSphere/ESXi
        - 2.53 GHz(2011 Q1 processor)
    - in both, 8G of RAM assigned to jitsi (new machine has 24G we can assign if needed)

### Discussions

- Final steps to close out HST ticket https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/120
    - use conventional method for ITCs
    - mission work? Deal with it when the time comes
    - >use accrual method of accounting, and set up to remit taxes based on invoices (not collected cash)
        - yj: when does HST get remitted, hits when you use/invoice (accural method) vs. collect/pay (cash method)
        - yj prefers accural, he thinks pc prefers cash
        - cash method is more straight-forward, good for small biz
        - accural method provides more forecast, good for self-employed
        - bl: if we bill a client 10,000, we are on the hook for 1,300 to CRA
            - cash method: when we receive the money
            - accural method: when we send the invoice
        - yj, bl: **decision to start with cash method**
- Payroll period vs. payroll cycle, revisions to our current reporting
    - talked about this yesterday, bl will do it for upcoming cycles
- Support members in their CERB application where needed
    - did this yesterday
- CEWS (75%) and BCAP (40,000 loan with 25% forgiven) follow-up
    - yj: we may qualify for one of the things for CEWS
    - #todo yj to follow up on CEWS
    - #todo revisit BCAP around June (when we hit 20,000 payroll)
