    - Roughly, act requirements:
        - (audited) financial statements
        - confirm board of directors
        - formally approve bylaws (bc it's our first)
        - any member can bring any business
    - Balance that against "vision" aspects that you all gave us feedback on, will also include:
        - in-person, social aspects, hangs with others
        - collective and individual goal setting (peer model)
        - WG reports, financial one most important
- **IP assignment**. Needed?
    - dc: not for next client which is starting ASAP. not sure about other factors
