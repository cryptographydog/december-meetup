	- ASN. when money comes, we apply
	- server setup. new deadline Oct 1, 2020
	- light weight services. includ. persistence in VMs. new deadline Oct 1, 2020

### Discussions

- Persistence storage
    - FreeNAS replicating to el's infra, need to set up NFS share, mount in vision board
        - Problem: vision board needs a persistent store bc Ansible only spins up the service
        - Expectations: auto-mount from VM, service read/write data from there, no need for encryption for this (but should be able to suppot it), backup off-site
        - Solution: VM boots and mounts NFS, mounts gocryptfs for fuse (is used for OVH backups) if there is a vol for it, read write to `/media/storage`, the remote is on FreeNAS, in an indep OVH VM, ZFS snapshot pulled to elon's infra and OVH VM backup on OVH backup dir
        - Current status: FreeNAS VM set up, need to create NFS scripts and mount VM to it, in ansible
        - Roadmap: deploy vision site in stg then prod, add docs, and tell everyone
- Meet.coop
    - **access**: vpn -> get keys from tech team -> goto existing servers and acces keys
    - right now each server has its SSH user keys
        - ansible install keys on server and up to date
        - all BBB resources can be SSH'd only from within VPN
        - git.coop/meet
            - move all code back to here
                - DNS repo
                - Collocall's BBB codebase
                - Hypha's acces control
    - **procurement**: we expense servers to Meet.coop OC
        - move Koumbit invoices to us
        - buy new servers from OVH
        - ask Hema about tax
    - **monitor**: Collocall has grafana monitoring hooked up, clone to our whole infra
        - Collocall until 4 pm CEST, Hypha from 10 am ET
        - Elon and Yurko (for redundancy)
