## Notes

### Co-work

- AGM Wrap up

### Discussions

- OKRs and org goals
- Reviewed Q1/2 reviews
    - O1 done 
    - O2 moved into Ops
    - O3 Host initial Annual General Meeting by fiscal year-end			
        - hosted AGM!
    - O4 Build organization-wide understanding of governance			
        - modest improvement demonstrated
- What's currently on the board?
    - Post-AGM wrap up (some moving into fall)
    - Good members piece
    - Organizational values? --- is there a gov tagged gh issue for this? no?
    - Moving into thinking about collaborators?
        - ~~Hiring~~ Membership requirements (governance side)
            - What we look for in a member
            - Member diversity & anti-black racism thread  #311
            - Organizational values and how that gets translated to policies #76 #234 
    - dc: A take on them grouped:
        - Continue to develop our governance muscles (slow burn)
        - *** Set up for Y2 and beyond (wrap up tasks on board) <-- Q3 emphasis
        - Values into practice: collaborators, members
- OKRs
    - O1: Ensure our governance structures set us up for Y2 and beyond
        - KR: Consult professionals (legal & accounting) over bylaws			
        - KR: Complete AGM wrap up
        - KR: Publicly share bylaws with aspects translated into plain language in our handbook
    - O2: Develop early strategy for embodying our values in practice (cross-cut with Gov WG) [Goal 8]
        - KR: Host initial conversations about values in specific contexts
    - O3: Create initial good member statement from AGM conversations (cross-cut Gov WG) [Goal 7]
        - KR: Draft statement emphasizing individual accountability adopted at all-hands
- Check-in on Ops KRs?
  - One of these needs to move forward:
	  - KR	Map existing tasks to roles
    - KR	Identify struggles that WGs face around collaboration and match to needed supports
