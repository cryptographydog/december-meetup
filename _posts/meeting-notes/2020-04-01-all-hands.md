        - el: think it looks good
        - uv (in chat): a reaction-diffusion/cellular automaton experiment that i was playing with a few weeks ago which is very similar in style to the dithering of pixels. you'll need to drag cursor on the red to start the reaction http://patterns.fromlater.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
