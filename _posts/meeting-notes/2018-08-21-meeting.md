## Sync Up

- Each person share what they've been up to
    - benhylau
        - getting infra ready for OurNetworks
        - IPFS livestreaming. watchers are seeders. cheap way to livestream widely. lots of work with ipfs and partners who have interest in this.
            - ended up using minimal features that would allow HQ livestream to work.
            - 10 people streamed. low number but well-received, and lots of attention from ipfs team.
        - HOPE
            - prepping for meshstream demo. discovery component. stream video over ipfs, not internet. came from idea of mattz nicopace and benhylau. built for dweb during hope. yurko and ben.
        - dweb summit
            - feedback: event livestreaming is a pain for small events, so there seems to be a niche
            - science fair demo of meshstream.
            - workshop went better than expected! better than library. more technical ppl.
        - sustainable open source funding panel
            - panelists: nicopace@librerouter, dominic@ssbc, ...
            - benhylau feels most aligned to ssb ppl. very community oriented. "when money comes, how do we use it to strenghten community relationships. NOT about features."
            - goals: use money to do more impact
            - patcon: YouTube: [Author summary of social physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMBl0ttu-Ow)

                - https://github.com/jnny/fundingopensource/issues/3
        - Protocol Labs support opportunity
            - evan = research, juan = ceo, mattz = projects
            - they feel course/workshop is a part of their existing goals

                - want to help make facilitation easier. cost of hardware, etc.
                - travel costs to present or help other groups run workshop
            - udit: what does november plan look like?
                - start meeting f2f. start talking details. set up plan to execute. governance.

        - range that PL can commit to is huge ($5K - $200K) based on https://protocol.ai/blog/ann-research-rfp/
        - has to do with whether it makes sense, and whether there is confidence in producing something
