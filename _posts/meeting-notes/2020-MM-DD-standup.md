## Discussions

- open collective call (ben)
    - pc > dc. will sched after. tues or wed #todo book.
- holiday hours (dc+pc)
    - > also all, Ops has a proposal for "holiday hours" during which we can consider Hypha to be closed for client work and also internal meetings. Given the extraordinary circumstances that 2020 has brought, 1) we should feel a sense of accomplishment for all that we achieved; 2) we should take time to recharge. To that end, we're hoping to take 3 weeks from **Sat, Dec 19, 2020 - Sun Jan 10, 2021**, anticipating we might need to have someone(s) be willing to respond to emails from Jan 4 on. Looking forward to discussing and confirming on Wednesday all hands -- if we should shift those dates to be more inclusive please let us know. I'm feeling pretty strong abou t us taking an extended "official" break tho I will say.
    - no internal calls until Jan 10
    - someone to answer email Jan 4=> ben
    - 3 weeks from Sat, Dec 19, 2020 - Sun Jan 10, 2021
        - no expectation for people showing up
        - DEADLINE: Dec 18 
            - Clockify hours in (all)
            - Invoicing sheet (project leads)
            - Payroll hours entered (project leads)
- holiday party (pc)
    - #todo look thru CRM list https://link.hypha.coop/crm
