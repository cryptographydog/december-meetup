        - Sub-contracts
    - OC
        - trust accounts are liabilities
        - Collective gets a "statement of account"
        - a Collective bills us, we need to hold an invoice/receipt
            - process:
                - 1. Collective submits invoice to oc@hypha.coop (Collective)
                - 2. Approve in OC and make Transferwise payment via OC (Finance)
                - 3. benedict@hypha.coop forwards to QBO inbox (Finance)
                - 4. Rodica deals with the bookkeeping (Rodica)
        - a Contributor pays us
            - we don't send invoice, it's a donation
            - e.g. $100 donation
                - ? payment processor
                - 5% -> OC
                - 5% -> host (Hypha)*
                - remainder -> trust (Hypha)*
            - end of year, Hypha adds 12 months of host fees, and invoice the trust account (taxable income component)
            - trust account is the aggregate trust balance of all Collectives we host
- Corporate tax return (T2 review)
    - Co-operative operating as a Not-[...]
    - Exempt under paragraph 149(1)(e) or (l) <- we are (l)
    - p.20 "05 Co-operative corporation" should be checked?
    - (56) vs (55)
    - p.30 delete line that says the photo credit
        - "Are any of the organization's activities carried on outside of Canada?" we do have US clients but I guess that doesn't count as activity?
    - #todo:bl email Hema
