## Notes

#### 4. Membership

- Member classes
- Member fees
    - [name=patcon] money vs time for buy-in
        - :heart: no desire to block on one-time or recurring fees, but only understanding it as means to create buy-in/ownership (initially), and healthy membership atrophy (recurring).
        - :heart: interested in finding other ways to guage/build the above things in long term. others seeem to agree.
        - :heart: Feel there are other, more aligned metrics to do that.
        - :heart: Feel inclined to set 0$ for all fees, and lean on some other metric.
        - Curious about using **time** as both buy-in metric, and yearly membership check-in.
        - :heart: Unsure if min % or static hours is best.
        - :mag: Time-tracking is category-specific, and knows "internal" vs "client-billable"
        - :heart: I feel our membership entry/renewal metric could be time-centric and category-specific.
        - Encourages time-tracking from the first stages of membership convos.
        - :mag: Mature and failed co-ops flagged time-tracking as very important step in growth.
        - :heart: building this capacity as part of member onboarding feels significant: "we don't want your money, but we want commitments to be legible to one another"
        - :mag: Traditional co-ops might not have a way to participate in internals before memberizing.
        - :mag: Our open source work and open resources mean that folks can contribute time before memberizing or even contracting.
        - :heart: Disclosure: I am prone to anti-patterns through overestimation of others' and underestimation of my own time commitments. But there are more systemic perks we've heard from other orgs.
- Relationship between employee and member, founding members
    - DC: From Fourth Pig, this can be more straightforward than thought. Recommend ALL sign articles of incorporation b/c benefits without obligations, but just the subset who indicated interest sign on as Directors of the Board.

- **Consensed on single class of membership**

- **Approved with no blocks** a $0 membership fee

- **Approved proposal for all involved to sign as a Founding Member but not as Initial Directors** (unless they want to) 

#### 5. Projects: Pricing and Leads 

- Leads and opportunities
- Project pricing
- Discuss alongside "first project" examples: Aether; ~~Fee-for-service Cloud~~; Consulting (Patcon's); Udit

Start with three pitches:

1. Aether (general sense of fit)
  - hourly rate are we okay with it?
  - some capcity, we are on the learning side (understood and okay with that)
2. Patcon's: Consult (less, but sense that it fits)
  - consultation; maybe moves into implementation (unclear)
  - Is it okay if projects are individual?
  - Prioritizing repeat and ongoing leads
  - timeline: immediate, lead generation
  - budget: unknown
3. Udit's (less clear but sense)
  - (unprepared)
  - lead through other employer involved in much larger set of strategy and development
      - sub outcomes: technologies they want to build: website; design deliverables
  - coop as vendor 
  - timeline: project mid-2020; implementation late-2020
  - budget: unknown (bit potential range)

Opening to discussion:

- Member involvement (stronger?)
  - *no issue or hard no with people running individual projects through the co-op*
  - build a texture/develop shape for involvement of multiple members important for now
- Are there things people don't want to work on?
  - e.g.: dc "no military contractors"
  - Develop a priority matrix as part of our strategic 
- #todo Leads (over time):
  - develop pitch template 
  - portfolio/bios
  - initial phase priority matrix
  - next step on Aether Pitch: async develpo project back
- Project Pricing
  - Hourly? Project rates?
- Reduction/discount for "neighbours"
- Retainer model (up to hours _or_ above # at a rate)
- Clear deliverables and scope (project management!!)
- Our internal calculations?
  - hourly
  - not seperate per role/hourly rate
  - but some "roles" e.g., admin, copywriting
  - (do we reveal an hourly rate that we bill out?)
- In lead discussions: we need to be armed with some "quick math": 
  - one-pager near term important
  - udit: bottom-up (hours); top-down (client; spend;)
- #todo Pricing next steps:
  - collect/share some examples 
  - task/rate sheet midterm goal
  - pricing math

#### 6. Compensation

- Relationship of "billable" and "non-billable" work and compensation
- Wage (Living Wage, Guaranteed Income)
- Preliminary discussion but needs more, in concert with project

#### 7. Financal Plan

- Y1 operating costs
- Projected income (profit-loss) statement
- Skipped due to lack of time

#### 8. Strategic Plan (lite)

- Skipped in interest of time

#### 9. Review/walkthrough Articles of Incorporation

- Had a ceremonial signing, photographed!
