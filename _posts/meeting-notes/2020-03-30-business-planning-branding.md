# 2020-03-31 Hypha Website/Branding Co-work session

Call to action:

Like others in the Great Lakes region and Toronto, weâ€™ve been closely monitoring the Novel Coronavirus 2019 situation via [Toronto Public Health](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/diseases-medications-vaccines/coronavirus/) and [Ontario Ministry of Health](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus).

We're offering assistance and sharing resources on how we work as a remote-first worker co-operative in solidarity with workers transitioning to working from home -> https://covid19.hypha.coop/

Who we are

We are a group of designers, engineers, sysadmins, researchers, and organizers who've worked together over the last four years in various combinations. We've brought our approaches from open-source and civic tech communities to projects with local and international clients.
