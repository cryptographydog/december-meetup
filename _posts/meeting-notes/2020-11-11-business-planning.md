<sup>[from template][template] | [:notebook: Meetings][meetings] | [:date: Calendar][calendar] | [:white_check_mark: Tasks][tasks] | [:cat: Code][gh] | [:open_file_folder: Drive][drive]</sup>

Time:       3:00-4:00pm ET  
Location:   https://link.hypha.coop/calls  
Attending:  pc, dc, uv  
Cultivator: dc  
Notetaker:  pc

## Summary

- we're committing to our :lock: [capacity-planning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LyElXvLj7ASclSPQqcgOnuEWqBWBStilEfOhIosZzhA/edit#gid=1841786771) :lock: for now
    - :lock: https://link.hypha.coop/capacity-planning
    - it should tell us (1) what's in pipeline, and (2) what are gaps/needs
- re: pipeline. needs tidy, and some legend to capture diff between
    - probability of work and
    - intensity of work if acquired
- re: skills gap. will create lightweight skills matrix (h/t dc) with LEAD/SUPPORT/GROW/NO
- business plan is awesome and mostly needs immediate tidy, and then next version in 2021
- lacking focus on showcase, so future bizdev coworks will strive for blog post output

## Notes

### Pre-game

- https://resources.platform.coop/
- uv: shared doma.city (art => company)
- infra vs platforming as way to align movement

### Personal Checkins

- ...(skipped)

### Discussions

- tcn/tomesh project framing/documenting
    - #todo dc follow up with elon 1:1
- #allhands capacity tracking (gantt charts?)
    - gsheet? hubspot revival?
    - :lock: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LyElXvLj7ASclSPQqcgOnuEWqBWBStilEfOhIosZzhA/edit#gid=1841786771
- uv: what we this needs to do:
    - what is coming down the pipe?
        - dc: rn, just on/off, no sense of hours. something missing
        - pc: dollars in spreadsheet? maybe proxies for work.
        - MATRIX:
            - this month/maybe/not
            - low/med/hi work
    - what skills are needed? what are skills gaps?
    - goal: to know what we can do in-house
    - dc: how do we even categorize our skills? what does that look like in a spreadsheet?
    - e.g. DSF project
        - start by looking at gaps?
    - skill matrix
        - #todo get member self-identification of skills
            - want a sense of LEAD versus DO, WANT TO LEARN/SHADOWING
        - pc: d&d character as skills? too complicated
        - spreadsheet for now. raw dump
        - dc: 15 min followup with ppl?
        - raw dump. refining into set.
    - colors: what do they mean in sheet?
        - probability vs intensity of work
        - probability is kinda below (?)
        - circle/color = intensity over time
        - #idea using unicode shiz
    - #todo dc: update to sheet
        - skills
        - legend
        - updating symbol in monthly columns
        - splitting up categories 
    - types ("validation" sheet)
        - client 
        - grant -- we wrote a grant for a project we have developed
            - didn't write all of them. don't need to worry about how ppl hiring us got money.
        - internal -- project inside hypha, not revenue generating or initated by outside org
        - member -- hypha is one of multiple stakeholders #todo UPDATE. stakeholder
        - solidarity -- we're doing this at a reduced raite
    - dc: important to know propertion of work from one-off grants vs ongoing client work vs product etc
        - perhaps mostly tracking grant vs non-grant
    - uv: from bizdev view, mostly concerned about how sales cyles differs. getting an idea of where we should be spending our time to develop new revenue streams.
        - dc: revenue streams?: service, project, client, grant
    - #todo create shortlink?
