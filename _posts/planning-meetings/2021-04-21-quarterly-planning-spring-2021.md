## Background and Intent

This is our first quarterly planning call as we sit on the cusp of an organizational transformation from a our existing structure to one that is more resilient, cross-functional, open to experimentation around new styles of collaboration, and has supportive structures in place for members’ learning, growth, and livelihood.

## Expected Outcomes

At the end of this planning session we will have:

1. Prioritized our goals for the upcoming quarter
2. Updated our member capacity
3. Made organization-wide decisions collectively to guide our next three months
4. Mapped out our initial list of initatives

    - Walkthrough of plan: https://link.hypha.coop/capacity [🔗 **Presentation**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vgJolxpqvpTjR6urjHTPrIAKFNMVnnEaAAQ8B-GBYSw/edit#slide=id.gd0d029c1f7_0_29)

- Finances update (Finances)
    - bl: 
        - aether has changed revenues quite a bit
        - budget doesn't reflect pre-aether numbers
        - each month 20K revenues
        - external contractors ~$2k-$7500 (variablility in COMPOST, START)
        - server costs for meet.coop in the 100's range
        - 13k-16k on member wages per month
        - 650 on op costs (licenses, etc.)
            - don't expect this number to grow significantly

        - internal hours aren't accurate
            - March wasn't a great time for us
        - flag risk: we need to track hours for the new model
        - good: we are spending more hours ext vs. internal
        - misalignment between capacity and who's doing work

Tracking:
- bl: how to track hours external hours? e.g. meet.coop? aether?
        - dc: no need for day-level granularity. just keep in same month.
    - yj: the way that take is done, might put below min wage
    - dc: we are striving for **month level accuracy** in clocklify
    - pc:
        - personal need minute level accuracy
        - dc: clockify works at a higher resolution than we  need collectively, track to your level of granularity

### Discussion: New initiatives mapping

- Work from [proposed] new initiatives from WGs, and miro board prepared by Call My Chrysalis initative: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lVt9EFQ=/

Discussion of initiative transition:
- bl: -1 to increasing clip. incentive to do more internal work.
    - "ok i shouldn't try to participate in external project, bc i can do internal"
    - dc: not able to run an employee off 25%. we're starving ourselves.
    - gi: clip too low. too rigid relative to projects we want to do.
- gi: curious about member loans. eventual model.
- uv: +1 to key metric. internal to external. keep measuring.
    - uv: diff kinda of internal
        - back office: automate, and reduce
    - not needed: dripline. having better granularity about internal work seems important
- uv: member loan. for active members to commit to a certain amount of time/month. e.g., 10h of operational work per month. if can't put in time via timebank, then should be paying in via loan.
- uv: strongly agree clip should be progressive. E.g., high amount for low-paying isn't sensible.
    - +1 yj to progressive
    - +1 to paying admin
- pc: +1 to higher clip
- dc: we're tracking less internal time, getting through setup
    - we are getting past boostrap mode
    - what is the reproduction rate?
    - external we're paid: $45/hr

Estimating hours:
- infra initiative:
    - improving productivity stack: 80 hours?
    - break off IT work
- Worked from transition modelling:
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWa3XPNsY-k6MtfAlNnUWy7kPCid65OUPooWMY6qpyY/edit?usp=drivesdk
    - **Consensed** on guidelines with 100 hours per month cap for Q2 (April-June)

Discussed and **consensed** on proposed pathway:
- Start July 1 @ 22.50 (living wage in Ontario)
    - paying everyone
    - introduce member requirements (MIN/MAX hours, track hours, good mem.)
- Cap hours @ 15/member mthly, cap internal hours 100 mthly Q3
- Increase clip to 35% internal (keep flat), grandfather exceptions
    - This increases wage floor: $35/hour billed work (something like $30/hour covers internal hours?)
- Enforce clip for contractors 40% (talk through exceptions)
- PARKING for now: Do member loan (!!) for $2000 (split quarterly) for roughly paying 1/3 total hours (annual: 200hrs @ $32/hr to pay living wage = $6400)
FY3 Targets: 
    - bill $250k without subcontracts to cover operating costs+internal work
    - contain/keep stable internal hours / mth at start (gains go to wage)



### Discussion: Financial forecast and budgeting

- Work from [draft] budget from Finance, and budget requests in advance: https://link.hypha.coop/budget 

The past two months is most representative of the current and near-future financial state of the Co-operative, so I will base my analysis mostly on numbers from these two months.

Each month, our **revenue is about $20,000** and we pay out **between $2,000 to $7,500 in project expenses (including subcontractors)**. We spend **between $13,500 to $16,000 on member wages** and **about $650 in operating costs**. See [Financial Projection sheet](https://link.hypha.coop/projections) for details.

Our monthly operating costs by working group looks like this:
- **Finance**: 2.25 (bank) + 56.50 (quickbooks) + 32.00 (wagepoint) + 200 (professional services) ~ $300
- **Operations**: 4.71 (cwcf) + 130.06 (insurance) ~ $135
- **Infrastructure**: 14.80 (domain) + 79.38 (server) + 16.15 (miro) ~ $110
- **Bizdev**: 100 (misc. marketing) ~ $100
- **TOTAL ~ $650 per month**

After all these, the Co-operative retains about $1,500 each month in profit (after the $650 operating costs is deducted), _which we can use to make a budget for various activities._

We will use this new sheet for budget planning: https://link.hypha.coop/budget

#### [Other] Requests received by Finance WG

Here is a list of requests made to the Finance WG, ordered by perceived priority and urgency:

- A pre-approved budget that WGs can have authority over, in particular for Bizdev WG on marketing and relationship-building activities
- More support for project leads in invoicing and wage assignment
    - This may be sufficiently addressed by recent process revisions
- More transparency about internal processes of this "blackbox" WG
- Flexibilities on how to interface with projects
    - e.g. retainer model (e.g. COMPOST), out-of-cycle invoicing (e.g. ACCA), complex setup with multiple client accounts for a single project (e.g. Meetcoop, possibly COMPOST), withholding of payroll amounts, reassigning money committed to one person to another person or use...
    - In general, most things are possible, and it comes down to two criteria:
        1. What lead time is needed to support a "new feature"
        2. Is the feature worth the effort (upfront and ongoing)

### Updating priorities for upcoming quarter

- Activity: Revisit goal prioritization for the upcoming quarter using loomio
  https://loomio.hypha.coop/d/XoKjmWx6/spring-2021-goals-prioritization
- How does this touch on WGs/Initiatives activities for next 3 months?
