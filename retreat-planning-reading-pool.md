Retreat Planning Reading Pool
=============================

Let's collect readings for the the retreat here. 

## Proposed Approach

To make this manageable for everyone, let's try breaking this work up into a few stages:

**Stage 1: Creating a long-list** of links, readings, topics, podcasts, discussions, videos (really any type of content) that people think is interesting and relevant to the co-op. During this stage it's totally okay if the list is pretty noisy because it would be good to have a divergent set of ideas. If you're on the fence about something being worth putting here, lean towards putting it in.

**Stage 2: Determining the most imporant themes** after discussing what was collected in stage 1, during a planning meeting (Oct 17th??).

**Stage 3: Creating a short list of readings**
