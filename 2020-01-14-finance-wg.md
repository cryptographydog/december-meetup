## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- pc: eager to start working and get clients in
- bl: opportunities! horizons! butttttt risk without guarantees. possibility != security. parents in greeeeece.
- yj: concern of spending more than we have. HATE.JS

### Task Board Review

- Archive _Done_ tasks :tada:
- Review [HIGH `[priority-★★★]`][l-pri-hi]
    - #156 payroll. done. will discuss
    - private#4 transferwise. done. can check off in discussion.
    - #154 quickbooks setup. no progress. patcon needs to move it fwd.
    - #... bookkeeper. assigned to patcon, as he's become touchpoint. will update in discussion.
    - #134 credit card. no progress. yj: there a block? no.
        - pc: might
- Triage new tasks
    - #todo create task for expense reimbursement process
- missing labels [`wg:NULL`][l-none] | [`[priority-NULL]`][l-pri-none]

### Discussions

- TransferWise retrospective
    - credit card has own risks. get money, but might not stay. new liability.
    - bl: should only deal with it when have to. more sense for lots of small transactions. may want to look at in future.
    - yj: recurring charges work well. warning: but very little recourse when chargeback.
    - yj: high fees.
    - patcon: don't feel convinced by critiques. etransfers win in canada over CC. but for domestic recurring (e.g., retainers), could be CAD$4/charge if <$3,000
    - bl: no need for CC now. transferwise for current client works. just for future recurring. :+1: pc yj
    - bl: need to do docs still
    - docs
        - blank out account # for handbook
- bookkeeper update
    - pc: planning to call Rodica to review books
    - pc: would like a contract, get into habit with working more formally
    - bl: contract or not, I just want to ensure we are in sync with expectations
    - pc: cross out items on contract?
        - bl: no, just email reply an sync up expectations and budget
    - yj: small businesses I know have bookkeeper update the books each month, now we are doing it ourselves
        - thinking on budget and when to transition that work to bookkeeper...
    - pc: once running, are we being more handsoff with services we're using of hers?
    - bl reiterates that not setting budgets and not syncing expectations is a bad way to start business relationships
        - the only thing we can afford now is occasional consultation and monthly review of books
            - yj: maybe quarterly
    - #todo:pc reach out to Rodica to clarify expectations and set a first-year plan together after review of books 
- payroll discussions (skipped, for next week)
