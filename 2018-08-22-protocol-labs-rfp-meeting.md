## Agenda

* Generally, before funding PL loves
    * clear goals that are easy to evaluate progress on where everyone can see benefits of
    * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lfd91hi3nFlLRS1r-FHvK2ip2Ll6ukraufCgepw43bw/edit#gid=94942032
* 2018 goals sound okay
    * fund SSBC-style grants for curriculum development for facilitators
        * Remaining work to package workshop for non-technical facilitator that is outside of SSBC grant scope 
        * Making hardware easily accessible (discovery, purchasing, & shipping)
        * Curriculum collaborations with other third-parties (university in Florida, Toronto design group, Singapore opportunits follow-ups)
    * https://github.com/tomeshnet/p2p-internet-workshop

* 2019 goals (first 6 months)
    * multiple possible projects - top priority would likely be a decentralized application server (hardware, software, & curriculum)
    * ideally ~$100k from PL to hire (two) developers
    * tasks to justify $ spent on specific goals

## Notes

### New 2019 Project Ideas

#### P2P Applications on Offline Networks

* Based on Workshop tech stack
* Raspberry Pi based with long-term roadmap to integrate with LibreRouter
* Discussions with IPFS, SSB, Aether, etc.
* Identified needs such as: discovery, peering, UI, offline bootstrap, resource constraints

#### Citizen Science on Steamlink

We are developing a set of community tools for citizens to collect environmental data and collaborate on experiments together. By exploring participatory methods and developing hardware and software, this project aims to curb the growing mistrust in science by engaging the public as they design their own community-based experiments. Additionally, learning science through community tools introduces a new avenue to teach information and network technologies from sensors and microprocessors to browsers and front-end data visualization. Our future work involves building workshops and curriculum as well as refining the current technology platform to deliver science education that's meaningful, informative, and inclusive.

Current Features Include:

* Programmable off-the-shelf open-source micro-controller boards to collect sensor data
* Low power LoRa radios to transmit data to the community base-station
* Collaborative data visualization and analysis web platform
* Monitoring and remote management of the network nodes through web console

## Actionable Items

* benhylau to send USD 5000 invoice
* benhylau to send something similar to 2018 commitment, but with 3-targets for first 6 months of 2019
    * justify why this is useful, things that will be possible that weren't possible before
    * technical, high level architectural decisions, challenges
* PL should be able to decide 2-4 weeks from presentation
