## Notes

### Story so far

- What we can so as org to support us in the crisis that is unfolding

- Could talk through what people think is needed, go around and share?
- UV: tl:dr:
    - ideas for response in chat
    - resources and practices being shared on gh issue 
    - question: what we could do?


### Supports for us as an organization

- dc: Can we bracket out our internal ops approach, especially given timing. plan for that convo more in all hands

### Our solidarity response

Round-robin brainstorm:
- bl: can help with things, low capacity next week. can collaborate writing, content, materials. In isolation for week, more responsive than usual, current projects heavy on plate
- uv: help people transition to being more remote friendly
- uv: share our infra?
    - jitsi
    - matrix
- gi: enabling orgs to be more remote friendly. documenting/sharing back our strategies, what's been working
    - reccomendations, best practices etc... 1-to-1
    - capacity? company full remote. still fulltime. same availability tho some days off
- el: could help with infra, maintaining/spinning up more stuff if needed. could also teach people how to use tools we're spinning up
- yj: 
    - capacity? busy at work. still fulltime, lots of uncertainty given how work unfolds. limited capcity. Still able to support infra, ad hoc right now
- dc:
    - on self isolation, completely canceled plans. more time than anticipated. part-time to full time amount of work to be done. uoft is in covid brain. more slack in phd work. lots of ideas
        - offering 1-1 consults; soundboarding; no-prep
        - provide/share infra for orgs; low use; nice gesture
        - sol networks neighbourhood or block level
        - here's all the work people have done around remote transition
        - more ambitiously: co-op relationship development; change movement culture (from NCBA call)
        - another call on Monday co-hosted by cwcf
- uv:
    - offering office hours for people to drop in, finding collective solutions
    - putting together simple website with links and resources (incl. our own)
    - what is our process for responding to requests for hosting, etc...?
    - new matrix channel for people to come together and raise issues, share what they are p to? see how we can help?
    - building rel'ns with other orgs and co-ops. think we should and that's a good idea

Capacity:
- Given identified capacities:
    - approach that is flex, low-commitment
