## Co-drafting vision & mission

‚úçÔ∏è Co-draft Positioning Template:

For "our members and neighbours" (who we serve) 
who "are looking for meaningful livelihoods while building and learning about technologies together" (the needs we serve)
our co-operative is a "resilient respite, radical garden, and safe harbour" (classification or category)
where we "support each other, work in solidarity, cultivate collective growth" (compelling reason for us to work together)
unlike "people serving capital" (current state of affairs)
our organization "provides autonomy and democratic control" (primary point of difference)

Ideation:

- Catalyst
- Launchpad
- Incubator
- Spinning up other nodes

Fitting in to the broader social movement
- Do we want to be part of systems change at large?
    - At the minimum we are acknowledging it exists 
    - Dawn: Not interested in the meta level, but how do we amplify the meta-level
    - SLIDER: 
        - MOVEMENT <--> PRODUCT
    - Ben also wants to not be the meta coop, and work on more specialized projects while supporting other people who want to form local coops, but perhaps through our skillsets?
- And in what way?
    - Knowledge
    - Technical Infrastructure
    - Transparency - default open source?
        - PARK THIS FOR LOOMIO

CLASSIFICATION or CATEGORY
- "technology workers co-op"
- Other descriptors:
    - Radical
    - anti-capitalist? resistance? Commons-based? Solidarity economies?
    - Respite (a.k.a, space for grace, forgiveness, care), refuge, haven, harbour, asylum, fortress?
    - Resilient
    - "Shift" "Transition"

COMPELLING REASON FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER
- Solidarity +1 / Allyship (Accomplice)
    - Take on larger projects
    - Bigger risks
- Community
- Cultivating ideas
- Soundboarding
- Weathering market forces and systemic pressures together
- Don't have to waste effort on debating fundamental value alignment and focus on meaningful work (Ben: I think this relates to Yurko's points, and earlier talk with Udit about encoding more information into protocol and transmitting less data packets)
- Aspirations and needs
- Consensual collective hallucination
    - We are a collective halluncination believing in better futures?
- Peer-to-peer skill building
- Legal entity to take money from grants
- Support each other:
    - Don't have to work alone
    - Financial resilience
    - Creative and intellectual support

CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 
- Affected by systemic pressures/market forces
- Disatisfaction
- Fitting our skillset into existing openings
- Lack of imagination about what the future is
    - For tech at least, Silicon valley has silicon values
- Ben is uncomfortable building the dystopic future Udit as describing, specifically a technocapitalist one
- Ben wants to do work that spreads across multiple professions (e.g. software, hardware, politics, processes, community building, teaching, and being a student at the same time)
- Ben is uncomfortable with our society's failure to recognize talents that are not in high demand according to capital, and people's failure to imagine alternatives
- Dawn: "I don't see a way out of the current mess of inequality, climate change, late stage capitalism, that we find ourselves in and frequently disempowered from changing"
- Padding shareholder pockets
- Don't want to be put in a position by broader system where we have to compromise on values/enforce extractive practices on others

PRIMARY POINT OF DIFFERENCE
- Democractic control
- Being in a position to effect change
- Supporting ecosystems - IRL/URL
- Imagining alternatives
    - Speculative futures (???)
- Needs of people > needs of market
- Resilience, common goals, uncompromising on our values, "being our own boss", as opposed to being an unmoored ship
- Commons-based peer production > Privitized hierarchical market production
- Inclusivity + diversity as naturally emergent phenomenon > as a reaction to market forces
- Grow people > grow capital
- Social motive > profit motive
- "Open" membership > Market driven filters
- Donna Haraway:
    - Forcing ourselves to not look away?
    - Courage, confidence
- Courage to feel part of the solution/not part of the problem

**Consensed on adding this in LOOMIO**:

> For our members and neighbours who are looking for meaningful livelihoods while building and learning about technologies together. Our cooperative is a resilient respite--a radical garden and safe harbour--where we support each other, work in solidarity, and cultivate collective growth unlike people serving capital. Our organization provides autonomy, democratic control, and a space to imagine radical and alternative futures.
>* LOOMIO "technologies" scope
>* our co-operative is a _radical garden_ that _cultivates commons-based economies_
>* unlike _this technocapitalist future we are sold_ our organization _prioritizes people over capital_
